Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.\n\nDual therapy for H. pylori with lansoprazole: Amoxicillin, in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1‑year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected. (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.\n\n# 1.6 Usage\n\nTo reduce the development of drug‑resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Amoxicillin and other antibacterial drugs, Amoxicillin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n\n# 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n# 2.1 Dosing for Adult and Pediatric Patients > 3 Months of Age\n\nTreatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic, or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days' treatment for any infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. In some infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy.",

    "text": "# 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\n# 5.1 Anaphylactic Reactions\n\nSerious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin. Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. If an allergic reaction occurs, amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.\n\n# 5.2 Drug-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (DIES)\n\nDrug-induced enterocolitis syndrome (DIES) has been reported with amoxicillin use [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)], with most cases occurring in pediatric patients &#x3C;18 years of age. DIES is a non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction characterized by protracted vomiting occurring 1 to 4 hours after drug ingestion in the absence of skin or respiratory symptoms. DIES may be associated with pallor, lethargy, hypotension, shock, diarrhea within 24 hours after ingesting amoxicillin, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. If DIES occurs, discontinue Amoxicillin and institute appropriate therapy.\n\n# 5.3 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea",

    "text": "# 5.3 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea\n\nClostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.\n\n# 5.4 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria\n\nPrescribing amoxicillin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\n# 5.5 Use in Patients With Mononucleosis\n\nA high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, amoxicillin should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.\n\n# 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Anaphylactic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n- Drug-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (DIES) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n- CDAD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n# 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (> 1%) observed in clinical trials of amoxicillin capsules, tablets or oral suspension were diarrhea, rash, vomiting, and nausea.",

Dosing of amoxicillin should be modified in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger (≤ 3 months). [See Dosage and Administration(2.2).]\n\n# 8.5 Geriatric Use\n\nAn analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects. These analyses have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.\n\n# 8.6 Dosing in Renal Impairment\n\nAmoxicillin is primarily eliminated by the kidney and dosage adjustment is usually required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR &#x3C;30 mL/min). See Dosing in Renal Impairment ( 2.4) for specific recommendations in patients with renal impairment.\n\n# 10 OVERDOSAGE\n\nIn case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures as required. A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms.\n\nInterstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin1.\n\nCrystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria.\n\nRenal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration.

Dosing was at the start of a light meal following an overnight fast.\n\nOrally administered doses of amoxicillin suspension, 125 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 mL,",

In blood serum, amoxicillin is approximately 20% protein‑bound. Following a 1 gram dose and utilizing a special skin window technique to determine levels of the antibiotic, it was noted that therapeutic levels were found in the interstitial fluid.\n\n# Metabolism and Excretion\n\nThe half-life of amoxicillin is 61.3 minutes. Approximately 60% of an orally administered dose of amoxicillin is excreted in the urine within 6 to 8 hours. Detectable serum levels are observed up to 8 hours after an orally administered dose of amoxicillin. Since most of the amoxicillin is excreted unchanged in the urine, its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\n\n# 12.4 Microbiology\n\n# Mechanism of Action",

Studies to detect mutagenic potential of amoxicillin alone have not been conducted; however, the following information is available from tests on a 4:1 mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate (AUGMENTIN). Augmentin was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay. Augmentin was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival. Augmentin was negative in the mouse micronucleus test and in the dominant lethal assay in mice. Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test, and was negative in each of these assays. In a multi‑generation reproduction study in rats, no impairment of fertility or other adverse reproductive effects were seen at doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 2 times the 3 g human dose based on body surface area).\n\n# 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n\n# 14.1 H. pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence\n\nRandomized, double-blind clinical studies performed in the United States in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within 1 year) evaluated the efficacy of lansoprazole in combination with amoxicillin.",

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n\nAmoxicillin tablets, USP are indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY β-lactamase–negative) isolates of the designated bacteria in the conditions listed below:\n\n# 1.1 Infections of the Ear, Nose, and Throat\n\nDue to Streptococcus species (α- and β-hemolytic isolates only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or Haemophilus influenzae.\n\n# 1.2 Infections of the Genitourinary Tract\n\nDue to Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, or Enterococcus faecalis.\n\n# 1.3 Infections of the Skin and Skin Structure\n\nDue to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic isolates only), Staphylococcus spp., or E. coli.\n\n# 1.4 Infections of the Lower Respiratory Tract\n\nDue to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic isolates only), S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or H. influenzae.\n\n# 1.5 Gonorrhea, Acute Uncomplicated (ano-genital and urethral infections)\n\nDue to Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\n\nBecause of high rates of amoxicillin resistance, amoxicillin tablets, USP are not recommended for empiric treatment of gonorrhea. Amoxicillin tablets, USP use should be limited to situations where N. gonorrhoeae isolates are known to be susceptible to amoxicillin.\n\n# 1.6 Triple Therapy for Helicobacter pylori with Clarithromycin and Lansoprazole",

Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.\n\n# 1.7 Dual Therapy for H. pylori with Lansoprazole\n\nAmoxicillin tablets, USP, in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules as dual therapy, are indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected. (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n# 2.1 Dosing for Adult and Pediatric Patients > 3 Months of Age\n\nExcept for gonorrhea, treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days’ treatment for any infection caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. In some infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy.",

Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. These reactions are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity and/or a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 5.2 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea\n\nClostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.\n\nC. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents.",

Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.\n\n# 5.3 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth or Bacterial Resistance\n\nThe possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy. If superinfections occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing amoxicillin either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient, and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\n# 5.4 Use in Patients With Mononucleosis\n\nA high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus amoxicillin should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.\n\n# 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Anaphylactic reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n- CDAD [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n\n# 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (> 1%) observed in clinical trials of amoxicillin capsules, tablets or oral suspension were diarrhea, rash, vomiting, and nausea.\n\nTriple Therapy: The most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received triple therapy (amoxicillin/clarithromycin/lansoprazole) were diarrhea (7%), headache (6%), and taste perversion (5%).\n\nDual Therapy: The most frequently reported adverse events for patients who received double therapy amoxicillin/lansoprazole were diarrhea (8%) and headache (7%).

Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to amoxicillin.\n\n- Infections and Infestations: Mucocutaneous candidiasis.\n- Gastrointestinal: Black hairy tongue, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].\n- Hypersensitivity Reactions: Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Serum sickness–like reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and urticaria have been reported.\n- Liver: A moderate rise in AST and/or ALT has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Hepatic dysfunction including cholestatic jaundice, hepatic cholestasis and acute cytolytic hepatitis have been reported.\n- Renal: Crystalluria has been reported [see Overdosage (10)].\n- Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.\n- Central Nervous System: Reversible hyperactivity, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, confusion, convulsions, behavioral changes, and/or dizziness have been reported.\n- Miscellaneous: Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been reported.

Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin.\n\n# 7.2 Oral Anticoagulants\n\nAbnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.\n\n# 7.3 Allopurinol\n\nThe concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of amoxicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.\n\n# 7.4 Oral Contraceptives\n\nAmoxicillin may affect the gut flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 7.5 Other Antibacterials\n\nChloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.\n\n# 7.6 Drugs/Laboratory Interactions\n\nHigh urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST®, Benedict’s Solution, or Fehling’s Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX®) be used.\n\nFollowing administration of ampicillin or amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.\n\n# 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\n# 8.1 Pregnancy",

Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2000 mg/kg (3 and 6 times the 3 g human dose, based on body surface area). There was no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, amoxicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\n\n# 8.2 Labor and Delivery\n\nOral ampicillin is poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.\n\n# 8.3 Nursing Mothers\n\nPenicillins have been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman.\n\n# 8.4 Pediatric Use\n\nBecause of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed. Dosing of amoxicillin should be modified in pediatric patients 12 weeks or younger (≤ 3 months). [See Dosage and Administration (2.2).]\n\n# 8.5 Geriatric Use\n\nAn analysis of clinical studies of amoxicillin was conducted to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently from younger subjects. These analyses have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\nThis drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.

A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison-control center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms. Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin1.\n\nCrystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria.\n\nRenal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration.

These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antimicrobial drug product for treatment.\n\n# Dilution Techniques\n\nQuantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on dilution methods (broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ampicillin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 4.\n\n# Diffusion Techniques",

Studies to detect mutagenic potential of amoxicillin alone have not been conducted; however, the following information is available from tests on a 4:1 mixture of amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate. Amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate was non-mutagenic in the Ames bacterial mutation assay, and the yeast gene conversion assay. Amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival. Amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate was negative in the mouse micronucleus test and in the dominant lethal assay in mice. Potassium clavulanate alone was tested in the Ames bacterial mutation assay and in the mouse micronucleus test, and was negative in each of these assays. In a multi-generation reproduction study in rats, no impairment of fertility or other adverse reproductive effects were seen at doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 2 times the 3 g human dose based on body surface area).\n\n# 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n\n# 14.1 H. pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence\n\nRandomized, double-blind clinical studies performed in the United States in patients with H. pylori and duodenal ulcer disease (defined as an active ulcer or history of an ulcer within 1 year) evaluated the efficacy of lansoprazole in combination with amoxicillin capsules and clarithromycin tablets as\n\n\n\n\n\nThe efficacy of lansoprazole in combination with amoxicillin capsules and clarithromycin tablets as triple 14-day therapy, or in combination with amoxicillin capsules as dual 14-day therapy, for the eradication of H. pylori.

They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When amoxicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by amoxicillin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.\n\nPatients should be counseled that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics, and it usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken their last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.\n\nPatients should be aware that amoxicillin contains a penicillin class drug product that can cause allergic reactions in some individuals.\n\nCLINITEST® is a registered trademark of Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, and Ames Company, Inc.\n\nCLINISTIX® is a registered trademark of Bayer Healthcare Llc, and Ames Company, Inc.\n\nCLOtest® is a registered trademark of Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc.\n\n875 mg label\n\n\n\n\n\n9111/S    10-9L0-298993ON\n# AMOXICILLIN\n\namoxicillin tablet, film coated tablet\n\n2020\n\n# Product Information\n\nCaution: Federal law prohibits transfer of this drug to any",

Concomitant use of cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, tipranavir plus ritonavir, or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with atorvastatin calcium tablets is not recommended. Atorvastatin calcium tablet dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain anti-viral, azole antifungals, or macrolide antibiotic medications [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been reported with atorvastatin co-administered with lipid modifying doses (> 1 gram/day) of niacin, fibrates, colchicine, and ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Consider if the benefit of use of these products outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].\n\nConcomitant intake of large quantities, more than 1.2 liters daily, of grapefruit juice is not recommended in patients taking atorvastatin calcium tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].",

The incidence of fatal hemorrhagic stroke was similar across treatment groups (17 vs. 18 for the atorvastatin and placebo groups, respectively). The incidence of non-fatal hemorrhagic stroke was significantly higher in the atorvastatin group (38, 1.6%) as compared to the placebo group (16, 0.7%). Some baseline characteristics, including hemorrhagic and lacunar stroke on study entry, were associated with a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the atorvastatin group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Consider the risk/benefit of use of atorvastatin calcium tablets 80 mg in patients with recent hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n# 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\nThe following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:\n\n- Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n- Immune-Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n- Hepatic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n- Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]\n\n# 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience",

In patients taking clarithromycin or itraconazole, do not exceed atorvastatin calcium tablets 20 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use of other azole antifungals or macrolide antibiotics with atorvastatin calcium tablets. Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug.\n\nExamples: Erythromycin, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole.\n\n# Niacin\n\nCases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been observed with concomitant use of lipid modifying dosages of niacin (≥ 1 gram/day niacin) with atorvastatin calcium tablets. Consider if the benefit of using lipid modifying dosages of niacin concomitantly with atorvastatin calcium tablets outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug.\n\n# Fibrates (other than Gemfibrozil)\n\nFibrates may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with atorvastatin calcium tablets. Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with atorvastatin calcium tablets outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

Atorvastatin calcium tablets decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol; therefore, atorvastatin calcium tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. In addition, treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long-term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients.",

Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with atorvastatin calcium tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug-associated risk of miscarriage (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered atorvastatin at doses that resulted in up to 30 and 20 times, respectively, the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg, based on body surface area (mg/m2).

In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births.\n\n# Animal Data",

In animal models, atorvastatin lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in the liver and by increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL; atorvastatin also reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.\n\n# 12.2 Pharmacodynamics",

    "text": "# 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\n\n\n\n\n# 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\n# Absorption\n\nAtorvastatin calcium tablets are rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in proportion to atorvastatin calcium tablet dose. The absolute bioavailability of atorvastatin (parent drug) is approximately 14% and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30%. The low systemic availability is attributed to presystemic clearance in gastrointestinal mucosa and/or hepatic first-pass metabolism. Although food decreases the rate and extent of drug absorption by approximately 25% and 9%, respectively, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, LDL-C reduction is similar whether atorvastatin calcium tablets are given with or without food. Plasma atorvastatin concentrations are lower (approximately 30% for Cmax and AUC) following evening drug administration compared with morning. However, LDL-C reduction is the same regardless of the time of day of drug administration.\n\n# Distribution\n\nMean volume of distribution of atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. Atorvastatin is ≥ 98% bound to plasma proteins. A blood/plasma ratio of approximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells.\n\n# Elimination\n\n# Metabolism\n\nAtorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated derivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of atorvastatin. Approximately 70% of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the importance of atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent with increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin in humans following co-administration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozyme [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. In animals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.\n\n# Excretion",

These findings occurred at plasma AUC (0-24) values of approximately 6 times the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 mg oral dose.\n\nIn vitro, atorvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the following tests with and without metabolic activation: the Ames test with *Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli*, the HGPRT forward mutation assay in Chinese hamster lung cells, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells.

Inclusion in the trial required 1) a baseline LDL-C level ≥ 190 mg/dL or 2) a baseline LDL-C level ≥ 160 mg/dL and positive family history of FH or documented premature cardiovascular disease in a first or second-degree relative. The mean baseline LDL-C value was 219 mg/dL (range: 139-385 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin calcium tablets group compared to 230 mg/dL (range: 160-325 mg/dL) in the placebo group. The dosage of atorvastatin calcium tablets (once daily) was 10 mg for the first 4 weeks and uptitrated to 20 mg if the LDL-C level was > 130 mg/dL. The number of atorvastatin calcium tablet-treated patients who required uptitration to 20 mg after Week 4 during the double-blind phase was 78 (56%). Atorvastatin calcium tablets significantly decreased plasma levels of total-C, LDL-C, TG, and apolipoprotein B during the 26-week double-blind phase (see Table 12).\n\n# Table 12: Lipid-altering Effects of Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets in Adolescent Males and Females with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia or Severe Hypercholesterolemia (Mean Percentage Change From Baseline at Endpoint in Intention-to-Treat Population)",

Atorvastatin was also studied in a three year open-label, uncontrolled trial that included 163 patients with HeFH who were 10 years to 15 years old (82 males and 81 females). All patients had a clinical diagnosis of HeFH confirmed by genetic analysis (if not already confirmed by family history). Approximately 98% were White, and less than 1% were Black, African American or Asian. Mean LDL-C at baseline was 232 mg/dL. The starting atorvastatin dosage was 10 mg once daily and doses were adjusted to achieve a target of &#x3C; 130 mg/dL LDL-C. The reductions in LDL-C from baseline were generally consistent across age groups within the trial as well as with previous clinical trials in both adult and pediatric placebo-controlled trials.\n\n# 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING",

Studies with the oral and intravenous forms of ciprofloxacin have demonstrated penetration of ciprofloxacin into a variety of tissues. The binding of ciprofloxacin to serum proteins is 20% to 40%, which is not likely to be high enough to cause significant protein binding interactions with other drugs. Following administration of a single dose of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, ciprofloxacin concentrations in urine collected up to 4 hours after dosing averaged over 300 mg/L for both the 500 mg and 1000 mg tablets; in urine excreted from 12 to 24 hours after dosing, ciprofloxacin concentration averaged 27 mg/L for the 500 mg tablet, and 58 mg/L for the 1000 mg tablet.\n\n# Metabolism\n\nFour metabolites of ciprofloxacin were identified in human urine. The metabolites have antimicrobial activity, but are less active than unchanged ciprofloxacin. The primary metabolites are oxociprofloxacin (M3) and sulfociprofloxacin (M2), each accounting for roughly 3% to 8% of the total dose. Other minor metabolites are desethylene ciprofloxacin (M1), and formylciprofloxacin (M4). The relative proportion of drug and metabolite in serum corresponds to the composition found in urine. Excretion of these metabolites was essentially complete by 24 hours after dosing. Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the coadministered drug (see CONTRAINDICATIONS; WARNINGS; PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).\n\n# Elimination",

    "text": "# Elimination\n\nThe elimination kinetics of ciprofloxacin are similar for the immediate-release and the ciprofloxacin extended-release tablet. In studies comparing the ciprofloxacin extended-release and immediate-release ciprofloxacin, approximately 35% of an orally administered dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug for both formulations. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete within 24 hours after dosing. The renal clearance of ciprofloxacin, which is approximately 300 mL/minute, exceeds the normal glomerular filtration rate of 120 mL/minute. Thus, active tubular secretion would seem to play a significant role in its elimination. Co-administration of probenecid with immediate-release ciprofloxacin results in about a 50% reduction in the ciprofloxacin renal clearance and a 50% increase in its concentration in the systemic circulation. Although bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after oral dosing with the immediate-release tablet, only a small amount of the dose administered is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. An additional 1% to 2% of the dose is recovered from the bile in the form of metabolites. Approximately 20% to 35% of an oral dose of immediate-release ciprofloxacin is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing. This may arise from either biliary clearance or transintestinal elimination.\n\n# Special Populations\n\nPharmacokinetic studies of the immediate-release oral tablet (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (> 65 years) as compared to young adults. Cmax is increased 16% to 40%, and mean AUC is increased approximately 30%, which can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly. Elimination half-life is only slightly (~20%) prolonged in the elderly. These differences are not considered clinically significant. (See PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use.) In patients with reduced renal function, the half-life of ciprofloxacin is slightly prolonged. No dose adjustment is required for patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections receiving 500 mg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Drug-Drug Interactions\n\nConcomitant administration with tizanidine is contraindicated.

(See CONTRAINDICATIONS).\n\nPrevious studies with immediate-release ciprofloxacin have shown that concomitant administration of ciprofloxacin with theophylline decreases the clearance of theophylline resulting in elevated serum theophylline levels and increased risk of a patient developing CNS or other adverse reactions. Ciprofloxacin also decreases caffeine clearance and inhibits the formation of paraxanthine after caffeine administration. Absorption of ciprofloxacin is significantly reduced by concomitant administration of multivalent cation-containing products such as magnesium/aluminum antacids, sucralfate, VIDEX® (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc. (See WARNINGS:PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and Information for Patients, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)\n\n# Antacids\n\nWhen ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets given as a single 1000 mg dose was administered two hours before, or four hours after a magnesium/aluminum-containing antacid (900 mg aluminum hydroxide and 600 mg magnesium hydroxide as a single oral dose) to 18 healthy volunteers, there was a 4% and 19% reduction, respectively, in the mean Cmax of ciprofloxacin. The reduction in the mean AUC was 24% and 26%, respectively. Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets should be administered at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, VIDEX® (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, other highly buffered drugs, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc. Although ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets may be taken with meals that include milk, concomitant administration with dairy products or with calcium-fortified juices alone should be avoided, since decreased absorption is possible.

The clinical significance of this interaction has not been determined. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.)\n\n# MICROBIOLOGY\n\n# Mechanism of Action\n\nThe bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from inhibition of topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV (both Type II topoisomerases), which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination.\n\n# Drug Resistance\n\nThe mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, is different from that of other antimicrobial agents such as beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, or aminoglycosides; therefore, microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to ciprofloxacin. There is no known cross-resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobials. Resistance to ciprofloxacin in vitro develops slowly (multiple-step mutation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Resistance to Ciprofloxacin\n\nResistance to ciprofloxacin due to spontaneous mutations occurs at a general frequency of between &#x3C; 10-9 to 1x10-6.\n\n# Activity in vitro and in vivo\n\nCiprofloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. Ciprofloxacin is slightly less active when tested at acidic pH. The inoculum size has little effect when tested in vitro. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) generally does not exceed the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) by more than a factor of 2.\n\nCiprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the package insert for ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets.\n\n# Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms\n\n- Enterococcus faecalis (Many strains are only moderately susceptible.)\n- Staphylococcus saprophyticus\n\n# Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms",

This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.

This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair. Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendon sites have also been reported. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Factors, in addition to age and corticosteroid use, that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported. Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture, and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non-quinolone antimicrobial drug.\n\n# Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis:\n\nFluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis.

This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids. Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets and contact their healthcare provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur (See Boxed Warning, WARNINGS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS/Post-Marketing Adverse Event Reports).\n\nIn a large, prospective, randomized ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets clinical trial in urinary tract infections, 49% (509/1035) of the patients were 65 and over, while 30% (308/1035) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and clinical experience with other formulations of ciprofloxacin has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Ciprofloxacin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. No alteration of dosage is necessary for patients greater than 65 years of age with normal renal function. However, since some older individuals experience reduced renal function by virtue of their advanced age, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients, and renal function monitoring may be useful in these patients. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)\n\nIn general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Therefore, precaution should be taken when using ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets with concomitant drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (e.g., class IA or class III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., known QT prolongation, uncorrected hypokalemia).",

    "text": "Patients whose therapy is started with ciprofloxacin I.V. for urinary tract infections may be switched to ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets when clinically indicated at the discretion of the physician. Ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets should be administered at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, VIDEX® (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder, other highly buffered drugs, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc.

(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-drug Interactions, PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and Information for Patients.)\n\n# Impaired Renal Function\n\nCiprofloxacin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion; however, the drug is also metabolized and partially cleared through the biliary system of the liver and through the intestine. These alternate pathways of drug elimination appear to compensate for the reduced renal excretion in patients with renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is required for patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections receiving 500 mg ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets. In patients with complicated urinary tract infections and acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis, who have a creatinine clearance of &#x3C; 30 mL/min, the dose of ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets should be reduced from 1000 mg to 500 mg daily. For patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, administer ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets after the dialysis procedure is completed.

(See WARNINGS.) Damage of weight bearing joints was observed in juvenile dogs and rats. In young beagles, 100 mg/kg ciprofloxacin, given daily for 4 weeks, caused degenerative articular changes of the knee joint. At 30 mg/kg, the effect on the joint was minimal. In a subsequent study in\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeagles, removal of weight bearing from the joint reduced the lesions but did not totally prevent them. Crystalluria, sometimes associated with secondary nephropathy, occurs in laboratory animals dosed with ciprofloxacin. This is primarily related to the reduced solubility of ciprofloxacin under alkaline conditions, which predominate in the urine of test animals; in man, crystalluria is rare since human urine is typically acidic. In rhesus monkeys, crystalluria without nephropathy has been noted after single oral doses as low as 5 mg/kg. After 6 months of intravenous dosing at 10 mg/kg/day, no nephropathological changes were noted; however, nephropathy was observed after dosing at 20 mg/kg/day for the same duration.\n\nIn mice, concomitant administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone and indomethacin with quinolones has been reported to enhance the CNS stimulatory effect of quinolones. Ocular toxicity seen with some related drugs has not been observed in ciprofloxacin-treated animals.\n\n# CLINICAL STUDIES\n\n# Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (acute cystitis)",

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.\n\nIf anaerobic organisms are suspected of contributing to the infection, appropriate therapy should be administered. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Therapy with ciprofloxacin tablets may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available appropriate therapy should be continued.\n\nAs with other drugs, some isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ciprofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial agent but also on the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.",

This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon, and has also been reported with the rotator cuff (the shoulder), the hand, the biceps, the thumb, and other tendons. Tendinitis or tendon rupture can occur, within hours or days of starting ciprofloxacin, or as long as several months after completion of fluoroquinolone therapy. Tendinitis and tendon rupture can occur bilaterally.\n\nThe risk of developing fluoroquinolone-associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is increased in patients over 60 years of age, in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart or lung transplants. Other factors that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity, renal failure, and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors. Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately if the patient experiences pain, swelling, inflammation or rupture of a tendon. Avoid fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, in patients who have a history of tendon disorders or have experienced tendinitis or tendon rupture (see ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.2)).\n\n# 5.3 Peripheral Neuropathy\n\nFluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, have been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin.

These doses were up to 0.3, 0.6, and 0.4 times the maximum recommended clinical oral dose in mice, rats, and rabbits, respectively, based on body surface area.\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Data\n\n# Human Data\n\nWhile available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, published data from prospective observational studies over several decades have not established an association with ciprofloxacin use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Available studies have methodological limitations including small sample size and some of them are not specific for ciprofloxacin. A controlled prospective observational study followed 200 women exposed to fluoroquinolones (52.5% exposed to ciprofloxacin and 68% first trimester exposures) during gestation. In utero exposure to fluoroquinolones during embryogenesis was not associated with increased risk of major malformations. The reported rates of major congenital malformations were 2.2% for the fluoroquinolone group and 2.6% for the control group (background incidence of major malformations is 1 to 5%). Rates of spontaneous abortions, prematurity and low birth weight did not differ between the groups and there were no clinically significant musculoskeletal dysfunctions up to one year of age in the ciprofloxacin exposed children.",

Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles, hand, shoulder, or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported. Caution should be used when prescribing ciprofloxacin to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids.

Approximately 40 to 50% of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. After a 250 mg oral dose, urine concentrations of ciprofloxacin usually exceed 200 mcg/mL during the first two hours and are approximately 30 mcg/mL at 8 to 12 hours after dosing. The urinary excretion of ciprofloxacin is virtually complete within 24 hours after dosing. The renal clearance of ciprofloxacin, which is approximately 300 mL/minute, exceeds the normal glomerular filtration rate of 120 mL/minute. Thus, active tubular secretion would seem to play a significant role in its elimination. Co-administration of probenecid with ciprofloxacin results in about a 50% reduction in the ciprofloxacin renal clearance and a 50% increase in its concentration in the systemic circulation.\n\nAlthough bile concentrations of ciprofloxacin are several fold higher than serum concentrations after oral dosing, only a small amount of the dose administered is recovered from the bile as unchanged drug. An additional 1% to 2% of the dose is recovered from the bile in the form of metabolites. Approximately 20% to 35% of an oral dose is recovered from the feces within 5 days after dosing. This may arise from either biliary clearance or transintestinal elimination.\n\n# Specific Populations\n\n# Elderly\n\nPharmacokinetic studies of the oral (single dose) and intravenous (single and multiple dose) forms of ciprofloxacin indicate that plasma concentrations of ciprofloxacin are higher in elderly subjects (older than 65 years) as compared to young adults. Although the Cmax is increased 16% to 40%, the increase in mean AUC is approximately 30%, and can be at least partially attributed to decreased renal clearance in the elderly. Elimination half-life is only slightly (~20%) prolonged in the elderly. These differences are\n\n\n\n# Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with reduced renal function, the half-life of ciprofloxacin is slightly prolonged. Dosage adjustments may be required [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)] and [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)].\n\n# Hepatic Impairment",

Although lidocaine treatment was well tolerated at this.\n\n\n\n\n# 12.4 Microbiology\n\n# Mechanism of Action\n\nThe bactericidal action of ciprofloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV (both Type II topoisomerases), which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination.\n\n# Mechanism of Resistance\n\nThe mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, is different from that of penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and tetracyclines; therefore, microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to fluoroquinolones occurs primarily by either mutations in the DNA gyrases, decreased outer membrane permeability, or drug efflux. In vitro resistance to ciprofloxacin develops slowly by multiple step mutations. Resistance to ciprofloxacin due to spontaneous mutations occurs at a general frequency of between &#x3C; 10-9 to 1x10-6.\n\n# Cross Resistance\n\nThere is no known cross-resistance between ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobials.\n\nCiprofloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1)].\n\n# Gram-positive bacteria\n\n- Bacillus anthracis\n- Enterococcus faecalis\n- Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)\n- Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)\n- Staphylococcus saprophyticus\n- Streptococcus pneumoniae\n- Streptococcus pyogenes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Gram-negative bacteria",

This is primarily related to the reduced solubility of ciprofloxacin under alkaline conditions, which predominate in the urine of test animals; in man, crystalluria is rare since human urine is typically acidic. In rhesus monkeys, crystalluria without nephropathy was noted after single oral doses as low as 5 mg/kg (approximately 0.07-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area). After 6 months of intravenous dosing at 10 mg/kg/day, no nephropathological changes were noted; however, nephropathy was observed after dosing at 20 mg/kg/day for the same duration (approximately 0.2-times the highest recommended therapeutic dose based upon body surface area).\n\nIn dogs, ciprofloxacin at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg by rapid intravenous injection (15 sec.) produces pronounced hypotensive effects. These effects are considered to be related to histamine release, since they are partially antagonized by pyrilamine, an antihistamine. In rhesus monkeys, rapid intravenous injection also produces hypotension but the effect in this species is inconsistent and less pronounced.\n\nIn mice, concomitant administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone and indomethacin with quinolones has been reported to enhance the CNS stimulatory effect of quinolones.\n\nOcular toxicity seen with some related drugs has not been observed in ciprofloxacin-treated animals.\n\n# 14.1 Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis-Efficacy in Pediatric Patients\n\nCiprofloxacin administered intravenously and/or orally was compared to a cephalosporin for treatment of cUTI and pyelonephritis in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years of age (mean age of 6 ± 4 years).

Inhalational Anthrax in Adults and Pediatrics\n\nThe mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin associated with a statistically significant improvement in survival in the rhesus monkey model of inhalational anthrax are reached or exceeded in adult and pediatric patients receiving oral and intravenous regimens. Ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in various human populations. The mean peak serum concentration achieved at steady-state in human adults receiving 500 mg orally every 12 hours is 2.97 mcg/mL, and 4.56 mcg/mL following 400 mg intravenously every 12 hours. The mean trough serum concentration at steady-state for both of these regimens is 0.2 mcg/mL. In a study of 10 pediatric patients between 6 and 16 years of age, the mean peak plasma concentration achieved is 8.3 mcg/mL and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrough concentrations range from 0.09 mcg/mL to 0.26 mcg/mL, following two 30-minute intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg administered 12 hours apart. After the second intravenous infusion patients switched to 15 mg/kg orally every 12 hours achieve a mean peak concentration of 3.6 mcg/mL after the initial oral dose. Long-term safety data, including effects on cartilage, following the administration of ciprofloxacin to pediatric patients are limited. Ciprofloxacin serum concentrations achieved in humans serve as a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit and provide the basis for this indication.1\n\nA placebo-controlled animal study in rhesus monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of 11 LD50 (~5.5 x 105 spores (range 5 to 30 LD50) of B. anthracis was conducted. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for the anthrax strain used in this study was 0.08 mcg/mL. In the animals studied, mean serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at expected Tmax (1 hour post-dose) following oral dosing to steady-state ranged from 0.98 mcg/mL to 1.69 mcg/mL. Mean steady-state trough concentrations at 12 hours post-dose ranged from 0.12 mcg/mL to 0.19 mcg/mL.6",

The one ciprofloxacin-treated animal that died of anthrax did so following the 30-day drug administration period.7\n\nMore than 9300 persons were recommended to complete a minimum of 60 days of antibacterial prophylaxis against possible inhalational exposure to B. anthracis during 2001. Ciprofloxacin was recommended to most of those individuals for all or part of the prophylaxis regimen. Some persons were also given anthrax vaccine or were switched to alternative antibacterial drugs. No one who received ciprofloxacin or other therapies as prophylactic treatment subsequently developed inhalational anthrax. The number of persons who received ciprofloxacin as all or part of their post-exposure prophylaxis regimen is unknown.\n\n# 14.3 Plague\n\nA placebo-controlled animal study in African green monkeys exposed to an inhaled mean dose of 110 LD50 (range 92 to 127 LD50) of Yersinia pestis (CO92 strain) was conducted. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin for the Y. pestis strain used in this study was 0.015 mcg/mL. Mean peak serum concentrations of ciprofloxacin achieved at the end of a single 60 minute infusion were 3.49 mcg/mL ± 0.55 mcg/mL, 3.91 mcg/mL ± 0.58 mcg/mL and 4.03 mcg/mL ± 1.22 mcg/mL on Day 2, Day 6 and Day 10 of treatment in African green monkeys, respectively.

Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ciprofloxacin tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.\n\n# Administration Instructions\n\nInform patients that ciprofloxacin tablets may be taken with or without food.\n\nInform patients to drink fluids liberally while taking ciprofloxacin tablets to avoid formation of highly concentrated urine and crystal formation in the urine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInform patients that antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc or didanosine should be taken at least two hours before or six hours after ciprofloxacin tablets administration. Ciprofloxacin tablets should not be taken with dairy products (like milk or yogurt) or calcium-fortified juices alone since absorption of ciprofloxacin may be significantly reduced; however, ciprofloxacin tablets may be taken with a meal that contains these products.\n\nAdvise patients that if a dose is missed, it should be taken anytime but not later than 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken and treatment should be continued as prescribed with the next scheduled dose. Double doses should not be taken to compensate for a missed dose.\n\n# Drug Interactions\n\n# Oral Antidiabetic Agents\n\nInform patients that hypoglycemia has been reported when ciprofloxacin and oral antidiabetic agents were co-administered; if low blood sugar occurs with ciprofloxacin tablets, instruct them to consult their physician and that their antibacterial medicine may need to be changed.\n\n# Anthrax and Plague Studies\n\nInform patients given ciprofloxacin tablets for these conditions that efficacy studies could not be conducted in humans for feasibility reasons.

Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.\n\nControl of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).\n\nNumerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.\n\nElevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying.",

Patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology. In these patients, lisinopril should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril and/or diuretic is increased. Avoid use of lisinopril in patients who are hemodynamically unstable after acute MI. Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nSurgery/Anesthesia\n\nIn patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, lisinopril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.\n\n# 5.5 Hyperkalemia\n\nMonitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving lisinopril.

The possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by either decreasing or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with lisinopril. If this is not possible, reduce the starting dose of lisinopril [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].\n\nLisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patient’s serum potassium frequently.\n\n# 7.2 Antidiabetics\n\nConcomitant administration of lisinopril and antidiabetic medicines (insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased blood-glucose-lowering effect with risk of hypoglycemia.\n\n# 7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)\n\n\n\n\nIn patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.\n\n# 7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)\n\nDual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.",

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue lisinopril as soon as possible.\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown. In the general U.S. population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\n# Clinical Considerations\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk\n\nHypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage).\n\nHypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.\n\nFetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nOligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.",

Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.\n\nClosely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to lisinopril for hypotension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# 8.2 Lactation\n\nRisk Summary\n\nNo data are available regarding the presence of lisinopril in human milk or the effects of lisinopril on the breast fed infant or on milk production. Lisinopril is present in rat milk. Because many drugs are secreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infants from ACE inhibitors, discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue lisinopril.\n\n# 8.4 Pediatric Use\n\nAntihypertensive effects and safety of lisinopril have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

    "text": "# 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n\n# 12.1 Mechanism of Action\n\nLisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of lisinopril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15% of patients had increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngreater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 6% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide for up to 24 weeks had a mean decrease in serum potassium of 0.1 mEq/L; approximately 4% of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately 12% had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated.",

    "text": "While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non Black patients. Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide further reduced blood pressure in Black and non-Black patients and any racial differences in blood pressure response were no longer evident.\n\n# 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\n\n# Hypertension\n\nAdult Patients: Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of the two drugs are approximately additive.\n\nIn most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by 6 hours. Although an antihypertensive effect was observed 24 hours after dosing with recommended single daily doses, the effect was more consistent and the mean effect was considerably larger in some studies with doses of 20 mg or more than with lower doses; however, at all doses studied, the mean antihypertensive effect was substantially smaller 24 hours after dosing than it was 6 hours after dosing.\n\nThe antihypertensive effects of lisinopril are maintained during long-term therapy.

Food does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase, which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of 12 hours.\n\nLisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25%, with large intersubject variability (6 to 60 percent) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. The absolute bioavailability of lisinopril is reduced to 16 percent in patients with stable NYHA Class II-IV congestive heart failure, and the volume of distribution appears to be slightly smaller than that in normal subjects. The oral bioavailability of lisinopril in patients with acute myocardial infarction is similar to that in healthy volunteers.\n\nImpaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have approximately doubled higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Patients receiving lisinopril (n=9646), alone or with nitrates, had an 11% lower risk of death (p=0.04) compared to patients who did not receive lisinopril (n=9672) (6.4% vs. 7.2%, respectively) at six weeks. Although patients randomized to receive lisinopril for up to six weeks also fared numerically better on the combined end point at 6 months, the open nature of the assessment of heart failure, substantial loss to follow-up echocardiography, and substantial excess use of lisinopril between 6 weeks and 6 months in the group randomized to 6 weeks of lisinopril, preclude any conclusion about this end point.\n\nPatients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with lisinopril, had a higher (9.0% versus 3.7%) incidence of persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x3C; 90 mmHg for more than 1 hour) and renal dysfunction (2.4% versus 1.1%) in-hospital and at six weeks (increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg per dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n# 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING\n\nLisinopril Tablets USP 2.5 mg are white colored, round, flat faced beveled edge tablets, debossed with \"E 1\" on one side and plain on the other side.\n\nUnit of Use Bottles of 90: 2.5mg (NDC 68645-608-90)\n\nLisinopril Tablets USP 5 mg are pink colored, round, flat faced beveled edge tablets, debossed with \"E 2\" and separated by scored line on one side and plain on the other side.",

    "text": "# 5.1 Lactic Acidosis\n\nThere have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\n\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\n\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n\n# Recommendations to Reduce the Risk of Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis\n\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n# Renal Impairment:",

    "text": "For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n# Renal Impairment:\n\nThe postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:\n\n- Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n- Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 [see Contraindications (4)].\n- Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.\n- Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n- In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/minute/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n# Drug Interactions:\n\nThe concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n# Age 65 or Greater:\n\nThe risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient’s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].\n\n# Radiological Studies with Contrast:",

    "text": "# Radiological Studies with Contrast:\n\nAdministration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets if renal function is stable.\n\n# 5. Surgery and Other Procedures:\n\nWithholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\n# 5.1 Hypoxic States:\n\nSeveral of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n# 5.2 Excessive Alcohol Intake:\n\nAlcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism, and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n# 5.3 Hepatic Impairment:\n\nPatients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n# 5.4 Vitamin B12 Deficiency",

    "text": "# 5.4 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn clinical trials of 29-week duration with metformin HCl tablets, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n# 5.5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues\n\nInsulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\n# 5.6 Macrovascular Outcomes\n\nThere have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets.\n\n# 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Lactic Acidosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]\n- Vitamin B12 Deficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]\n- Hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]\n\n# 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience\n\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.",

    "text": "# 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n# 8.1 Pregnancy\n\n# Risk Summary\n\nLimited data with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data]. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].\n\nNo adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 3 and 1 times, respectively, a 2,000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data].\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10 % in women with pregestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25 % in women with an HbA1c > 10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 %, respectively.\n\n# Clinical Considerations\n\nDisease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk\n\nPoorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, stillbirth and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.\n\n# Data\n\n# Human Data\n\nPublished data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.\n\n# Animal Data\n\nMetformin HCl was not teratogenic or embyrolethal when administered to rats prior to pregnancy through the period of organogenesis at doses up to 900 mg/kg, or when administered to rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 90 mg/kg.",

    "text": "# 8.2 Lactation\n\n# Risk Summary\n\nLimited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see Data]. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\n# Data\n\nPublished clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11 % to 1 % of the maternal weight-adjusted.\n\n\n\n\n\ndosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants.\n\n# 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\n\nDiscuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women.\n\n# 8.4 Pediatric Use\n\nSafety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n# 8.5 Geriatric Use\n\nClinical studies of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]\n\n# 8.6 Renal Impairment",

    "text": "# 8.6 Renal Impairment\n\nMetformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]\n\n# 8.7 Hepatic Impairment\n\nUse of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]\n\n# 10 OVERDOSAGE\n\nOverdose of metformin HCl has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10 % of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32 % of metformin overdose cases. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/minute under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected.\n\n# 11 DESCRIPTION\n\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP contains the biguanide antihyperglycemic agent metformin in the form of monohydrochloride salt.

    "text": "# Metformin Hydrochloride\n\nMetformin hydrochloride, USP is a white or almost white powder with a molecular formula of C4H11N5•HCl and a molecular weight of 165.62 g/mol. Metformin hydrochloride is freely soluble in water; slightly soluble in alcohol; practically insoluble in acetone, chloroform, ether, and methylene chloride. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6.68.\n\nMetformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets, USP contain 500 mg or 1,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride, which is equivalent to 389.93 mg or 779.86 mg metformin, respectively. Each 500 mg and 1,000 mg tablet contains carbomer homopolymer type A, carbomer homopolymer type B, dibasic calcium phosphate, dibutyl sebacate, ethylcellulose, hypromellose and magnesium stearate.\n\nMeets USP dissolution test 20.\n\n# 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n\n# 12.1 Mechanism of Action\n\nMetformin is a biguanide that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.\n\n# 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\n# Absorption",

    "text": "# 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\n# Absorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose of 1,000 mg (2 x 500 mg tablets) metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets after a meal, the time to reach maximum plasma metformin concentration (Tmax) is achieved at approximately 7 to 8 hours. In both single- and multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects, once daily 1,000 mg (2 x 500 mg tablets) dosing provides equivalent systemic exposure, as measured by area under the curve (AUC), and up to 35 % higher Cmax, of metformin relative to the immediate-release given as 500 mg twice daily. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally &#x3C; 1 mcg/mL.\n\nIn a two-way, single-dose, crossover study in healthy volunteers, the 1,000 mg tablet was found to be similar to two 500 mg tablets under fed conditions based on equivalent Cmax and AUCs for the two formulations.\n\nSingle oral doses of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets from 500 mg to 2,500 mg resulted in less than proportional increase in both AUC and Cmax.\n\nEffect of food: Low-fat and high-fat meals increased the systemic exposure (as measured by AUC) from metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets by about 38 % and 73 %, respectively, relative to fasting. Both meals prolonged metformin Tmax by approximately 3 hours but Cmax was not affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Distribution\n\nThe apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of 850 mg metformin HCl averaged 654±358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.\n\n# Metabolism\n\nIntravenous, single-dose studies in healthy subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans), nor biliary excretion.\n\n# Excretion",

    "text": "# Excretion\n\nRenal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90 % of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.\n\n# Special Populations\n\n# Renal Impairment\n\nFollowing a single-dose administration of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 500 mg in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment, the oral and renal clearance of metformin were decreased by 33 % and 50 % and 16 % and 53 %, respectively. Metformin peak and systemic exposure was 27 % and 61 % greater, respectively in subjects with mild renal impairment and 74 % and 2.36-fold greater in subjects with moderate renal impairment as compared to healthy subjects. [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]\n\n# Hepatic Impairment\n\nNo pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets have been conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment, [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]\n\n# Geriatrics\n\nLimited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin HCl in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased by 35 %, the half-life is prolonged by 64 % and Cmax is increased by 76 %, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function.

    "text": "# 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n\nIn a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel group study conducted in patients type 2 diabetes mellitus, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1,500 mg once daily, metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1,500 per day in divided doses (500 mg in the morning and 1,000 mg in the evening), and metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets 2,000 mg once daily were compared to immediate-release metformin HCl tablets 1,500 mg per day in divided doses (500 mg in the morning and 1,000 mg in the evening). This study included patients (n = 338) who were newly diagnosed with diabetes, patients treated only with diet and exercise, patients treated with a single antidiabetic medication (sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, or meglitinides), and patients (n = 368) receiving metformin HCl tablets up to 1,500 mg/day plus a sulfonylurea at a dose equal to or less than one-half the maximum dose. Patients who were enrolled on monotherapy or combination antidiabetic therapy underwent a 6 - week washout. Patients randomized to metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets began titration from 1,000 mg/day up to their assigned treatment dose over 3 weeks. Patients randomized to immediate-release metformin initiated 500 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 500 mg with breakfast and 1,000 mg with dinner for the second week. The 3-week treatment period was followed by an additional 21-week period at the randomized dose. The results are presented in Table 5.\n\n# Table 5: Mean Changes from Baseline in HbA1c and Fasting Plasma Glucose\n\n\n\n\n\nat Week 24 Comparing Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets versus Metformin HCl Tablets* in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",

These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.\n\nIf metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride. In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.\n\nEducate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.\n\n# Recommendations to Reduce the Risk of Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis\n\nFor each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:\n\n# Renal impairment\n\nThe postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.\n\nThe risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient’s renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:",

In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.\n- In patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.\n\n# Drug interactions\n\nThe concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 5.1 Risk of Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis\n\nAge 65 or greater — The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient’s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.\n\nRadiologic studies with contrast — Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.

Metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.\n\nHypoxic states — Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue metformin hydrochloride.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake — Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride.\n\nHepatic impairment — Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.\n\n# 5.2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency\n\nIn metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29-week duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].\n\n# 5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues",

Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity.\n\n# Data\n\n# Human Data\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished data from post-marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.\n\n# 8. Animal Data\n\nMetformin hydrochloride did not adversely affect development outcomes when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day. This represents an exposure of about 2 and 5 times a 2,550 mg clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits, respectively. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.\n\n# 8.2 Lactation\n\n# Risk Summary\n\nLimited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see Data]. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Therefore, the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for metformin hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\n# Data\n\nPublished clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants.\n\n# 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\n\nDiscuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin hydrochloride may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women.\n\n# 8.4 Pediatric Use",

In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].\n\n# 8.6 Renal Impairment\n\nMetformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. Metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].\n\n# 8.7 Hepatic Impairment",

It is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble in acetone, ether, and chloroform. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6.68. Metformin hydrochloride tablets, USP contain 500 mg, 850 mg, or 1,000 mg of metformin hydrochloride, which is equivalent to 389.93 mg, 662.88 mg, 779.86 mg metformin base, respectively. Each tablet contains the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate and povidone. In addition, the tablet coating material of 500 mg, 850 mg and 1,000 mg tablets contain hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 3350, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide and artificial blackberry flavor.\n\n# 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n\n# 12.1 Mechanism of Action\n\nMetformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease.\n\n# 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\n# Absorption\n\nThe absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50% to 60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride 500 to 1,500 mg and 850 to 2,550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride, steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally &#x3C;1 mcg/mL.",

Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time.\n\n# Metabolism\n\nIntravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion.\n\n# Elimination\n\nRenal clearance (see Table 4) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.\n\n# Specific Populations\n\n# Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased (see Table 3) [See Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].\n\n# Hepatic Impairment\n\nNo pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].\n\n# Geriatrics",

These doses are both approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2,550 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day.\n\nThere was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test (S. typhimurium), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative.\n\nFertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2,550 mg based on body surface area comparisons.\n\n# 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n\n# 14.1 Metformin Hydrochloride\n\n# Adult Clinical Studies\n\nA double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter U.S. clinical trial involving obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose hyperglycemia was not adequately controlled with dietary management alone (baseline fasting plasma glucose [FPG] of approximately 240 mg/dL) was conducted.

    "text": "# What should I avoid while taking metformin hydrochloride tablets?\n\nDo not drink a lot of alcoholic drinks while taking metformin hydrochloride tablets. This means you should not binge drink for short periods, and you should not drink a lot of alcohol on a regular basis. Alcohol can increase the chance of getting lactic acidosis.\n\n# What are the side effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets?\n\nLactic acidosis. Metformin, the active ingredient in metformin hydrochloride tablets, can cause a rare but serious condition called lactic acidosis (a buildup of an acid in the blood) that can cause death. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in the hospital.\n\nCall your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms, which could be signs of lactic acidosis:\n\n- you feel cold in your hands or feet\n- you feel dizzy or lightheaded\n- you have a slow or irregular heartbeat\n- you feel very weak or tired\n- you have trouble breathing\n- you feel sleepy or drowsy\n- you have stomach pains, nausea or vomiting\n\nMost people who have had lactic acidosis with metformin have other things that, combined with the metformin, led to the lactic acidosis. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following, because you have a higher chance for getting lactic acidosis with metformin hydrochloride tablets if you:\n\n- have severe kidney problems, or your kidneys are affected by certain x-ray tests that use injectable dye\n- have liver problems\n- drink alcohol very often, or drink a lot of alcohol in short-term “binge” drinking\n- get dehydrated (lose a large amount of body fluids). This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Dehydration can also happen when you sweat a lot with activity or exercise and do not drink enough fluids\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Common side effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets",

    "text": "# Common side effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets\n\nCommon side effects of metformin hydrochloride tablets include diarrhea, nausea, and upset stomach. These side effects generally go away after you take the medicine for a while. Taking your medicine with meals can help reduce these side effects. Tell your doctor if the side effects bother you a lot, last for more than a few weeks, come back after they’ve gone away, or start later in therapy. You may need a lower dose or need to stop taking the medicine for a short period or for good.\n\nAbout 3 out of every 100 people who take metformin hydrochloride tablets have an unpleasant metallic taste when they start taking the medicine. It lasts for a short time. Metformin hydrochloride tablets rarely cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) by themselves. However, hypoglycemia can happen if you do not eat enough, if you drink alcohol, or if you take other medicines to lower blood sugar.\n\n# How should I store metformin hydrochloride tablets?\n\nStore metformin hydrochloride tablets at 68°F to 77°F (20°C to 25°C). Keep metformin hydrochloride tablets and all medicines out of the reach of children.\n\n# General information about the use of metformin hydrochloride tablets\n\nIf you have questions or problems, talk with your doctor or other healthcare provider. You can ask your doctor or pharmacist for the information about metformin hydrochloride tablets that is written for healthcare professionals. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a patient information leaflet. Do not use metformin hydrochloride tablets for a condition for which they were not prescribed. Do not share your medicine with other people.\n\n# What are the ingredients of metformin hydrochloride tablets?\n\nActive ingredients of metformin hydrochloride tablets: metformin hydrochloride. Inactive ingredients in each tablet of metformin hydrochloride: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate and povidone. In addition, the tablet coating material of 500 mg, 850 mg and 1,000 mg tablets contain hypromellose, polyethylene glycol 3350, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide and artificial blackberry flavor.\n\n# What is type 2 diabetes?",

    "text": "# What is type 2 diabetes?\n\nType 2 diabetes is a condition in which your body does not make enough insulin, and the insulin that your body produces does not work as well as it should. Your body can also make too much sugar. When this happens, sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. This can lead to serious medical problems.\n\nThe main goal of treating diabetes is to lower your blood sugar to a normal level. High blood sugar can be lowered by diet and exercise, and by certain medicines when necessary.\n\nTalk to your healthcare provider about how to prevent, recognize, and take care of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), and problems you have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Metformin Hydrochloride\n\nNDC 50090-6856-0\n\nProduct No. 5373-0\n\nLOT\n\n# METFORMIN HYDROCHLORIDE 1000 MG\n\nEACH FILM-COATED TABLET CONTAINS:\n\nUSP 1000 MG\n\nSTORE AT 68 TO 77 DEGREES F\n\n60 TABLETS\n\n00350090685602 2\n\nA-S Medication Solutions\n\nLibertyville, IL 60048\n\n# METFORMIN HYDROCHLORIDE\n\nmetformin hydrochloride tablet, film coated\n\n# Product Information\n\n| Product Type            | HUMAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG               |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| Item Code               | NDC:50090-6856 (Source) NDC:42385-949 |\n| Route of Administration | ORAL                                  |\n\n# Active Ingredient/Active Moiety\n\n| Ingredient Name                                                           | Basis of Strength | Strength |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------- |\n| METFORMIN HYDROCHLORIDE (UNII: 786Z 46389E) (METFORMIN - UNII:9100L32L2N) | METFORMIN         | 1000 mg  |\n\nManufactured for:\n\nLaurus Generics Inc.\n\n400 Connell Drive\n\nSuite 5200\n\nBerkeley Heights, NJ 07922\n\nManufactured by:\n\nLaurus Labs Limited\n\nAnakapalli-531011\n\nIndia\n\nRevised: 8/2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Inactive Ingredients",

While warfarin sodium is contraindicated during pregnancy, the potential benefits of using warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient’s medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines.

Concomitant anticoagulation therapy with heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with warfarin sodium may minimize the incidence of tissue necrosis in these patients.\n\nEye surgery: In cataract surgery, warfarin sodium use was associated with a significant increase in minor complications of sharp needle and local anesthesia block but not associated with potentially sight-threatening operative hemorrhagic complications. As warfarin sodium cessation or reduction may lead to serious thromboembolic complications, the decision to discontinue warfarin sodium before a relatively less invasive and complex eye surgery, such as lens surgery, should be based upon the risks of anticoagulant therapy weighed against the benefits.\n\nPolycythemia vera\n\nVasculitis",

    "text": "# 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\n\n# 7.1 General Information\n\nDrugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism.\n\nMore frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [see Boxed Warning].\n\nConsult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding.\n\n# 7.2 CYP450 Interactions\n\nCYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4.

Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Because these data were not collected in adequate and well-controlled studies, this incidence of major birth defects is not an adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U.S. general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice.

Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) and growth retardation (including low birth weight).

Dosing of warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age, with infants generally having the highest, and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target INRs. Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age, concomitant medications, diet, and existing medical condition, target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric patients, and more frequent INR determinations are recommended.

No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\n\nPatients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in any unsupervised patient with senility.

Reversal of warfarin sodium anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing warfarin sodium therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1. The use of vitamin K1 reduces response to subsequent warfarin sodium therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of warfarin sodium administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of warfarin sodium is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to warfarin sodium overdosage.\n\n# 11 DESCRIPTION\n\nCrystalline warfarin sodium is an anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. The chemical name of warfarin sodium is 3-(α-acetonylbenzyl)-4-hydroxycoumarin sodium salt, which is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Crystalline warfarin sodium is an isopropanol clathrate. Its empirical formula is C19H15NaO4, and its structural formula is represented by the following:\n\nO  o\n\nH\n\nC\n\nONa  CH2COCH",

Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Vitamin K promotes the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the proteins that are essential for biological activity. Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K1 epoxide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].\n\n# 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\n\nAn anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration. However, peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days. The effects of warfarin sodium may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap. This is consistent with the half-lives of the affected vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and anticoagulation proteins: Factor II - 60 hours, VII - 4 to 6 hours, IX - 24 hours, X - 48 to 72 hours, and proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively.\n\n# 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\nWarfarin sodium is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers of warfarin. The S-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R-enantiomer in humans, but generally has a more rapid clearance.\n\nAbsorption\nWarfarin is essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with peak concentration generally attained within the first 4 hours.",

Approximately 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Metabolism\n\nThe elimination of warfarin is almost entirely by metabolism. Warfarin is stereoselectively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) microsomal enzymes to inactive hydroxylated metabolites (predominant route) and by reductases to reduced metabolites (warfarin alcohols) with minimal anticoagulant activity. Identified metabolites of warfarin include dehydrowarfarin, two diastereoisomer alcohols, and 4′-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 10- hydroxywarfarin. The CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme, is likely to be the principal form of human liver CYP450 that modulates the in vivo anticoagulant activity of warfarin. Patients with one or more variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased S-warfarin clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].\n\n# Excretion",

    "text": "# Excretion\n\nThe terminal half-life of warfarin after a single dose is approximately 1 week; however, the effective half-life ranges from 20 to 60 hours, with a mean of about 40 hours. The clearance of R-warfarin is generally half that of S-warfarin, thus as the volumes of distribution are similar, the half-life of R-warfarin is longer than that of S-warfarin. The half-life of R-warfarin ranges from 37 to 89 hours, while that of S-warfarin ranges from 21 to 43 hours. Studies with radiolabeled drug have demonstrated that up to 92% of the orally administered dose is recovered in urine. Very little warfarin is excreted unchanged in urine. Urinary excretion is in the form of metabolites.\n\n# Geriatric Patients\n\nPatients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. The cause of the increased sensitivity to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in this age group is unknown but may be due to a combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. Limited information suggests there is no difference in the clearance of S-warfarin; however, there may be a slight decrease in the clearance of R-warfarin in the elderly as compared to the young. Therefore, as patient age increases, a lower dose of warfarin is usually required to produce a therapeutic level of anticoagulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].\n\n# Asian Patients\n\nAsian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin. A non-controlled study of 151 Chinese outpatients stabilized on warfarin for various indications reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3.3 ± 1.4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2.5. Patient age was the most important determinant of warfarin requirement in these patients, with a progressively lower warfarin requirement with increasing age.\n\n# 12.5 Pharmacogenomics\n\n# CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Polymorphisms",

    "text": "# 12.5 Pharmacogenomics\n\n# CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Polymorphisms\n\nThe S-enantiomer of warfarin is mainly metabolized to 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme. The variant alleles, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, result in decreased in vitro CYP2C9 enzymatic 7-hydroxylation of S-warfarin. The frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11% and 7% for CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, respectively. Other CYP2C9 alleles associated with reduced enzymatic activity occur at lower frequencies, including *5, *6, and *11 alleles in populations of African ancestry and *5, *9, and *11 alleles in Caucasians.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarfarin reduces the regeneration of vitamin K from vitamin K epoxide in the vitamin K cycle through inhibition of VKOR, a multiprotein enzyme complex. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene (e.g., –1639G>A) have been associated with variable warfarin dose requirements. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 gene variants generally explain the largest proportion of known variability in warfarin dose requirements. CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype information, when available, can assist in selection of the initial dose of warfarin (see Dosage and Administration (2.3)).\n\n# 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\n\n# 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\n\nCarcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or fertility studies have not been performed with warfarin.\n\n# 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\n\n# 14.1 Atrial Fibrillation\n\nIn five prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials involving 3711 patients with non-rheumatic AF, warfarin significantly reduced the risk of systemic thromboembolism including stroke (see Table 4). The risk reduction ranged from 60% to 86% in all except one trial (CAFA: 45%), which was stopped early due to published positive results from two of these trials. The incidence of major bleeding in these trials ranged from 0.6% to 2.7% (see Table 4).",

This can happen soon after starting warfarin sodium. It happens because blood clots form and block blood flow to an area of your body. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have pain, color, or temperature change to any area of your body. You may need medical care right away to prevent death or loss (amputation) of your affected body part.\n- Kidney problems. Kidney injury may happen in people who take warfarin sodium. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop blood in your urine. Your healthcare provider may do tests more often during treatment with warfarin sodium to check for bleeding if you already have kidney problems.\n- “Purple toes syndrome.” Call your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in your toes and they look purple in color or dark in color.\n\nThese are not all of the side effects of warfarin sodium. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.\n\nCall your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulants if necessary. (5.2)\n- Calciphylaxis: Fatal and serious cases have occurred. Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. (5.3)\n- Acute kidney injury may occur during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. (5.4)\n- Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli: Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. Discontinue warfarin sodium if such emboli occur. (5.5)\n- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Initial therapy with warfarin sodium in HIT has resulted in cases of amputation and death. Warfarin sodium may be considered after platelet count has normalized.

Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known, and the initial dose is influenced by:\n\n- Clinical factors including age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities\n- Genetic factors (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]\n\nSelect the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation.\n\nIndividualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].\n\n# Dosing Recommendations without Consideration of Genotype\n\nIf the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of warfarin sodium is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily. Determine each patient's dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated. Typical maintenance doses are 2 to 10 mg once daily.\n\n# Dosing Recommendations with Consideration of Genotype\n\nTable 1 displays three ranges of expected maintenance warfarin sodium doses observed in subgroups of patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. If the patient's CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotype are known, consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose.

Other coinherited VKORC1 variants may also be important determinants of warfarin dose.\n\n# 2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation\n\nWarfarin sodium has a narrow therapeutic range (index), and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during warfarin sodium therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].\n\nDeterminations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of warfarin sodium therapy.\n\n# 2.5 Renal Impairment\n\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].\n\n# 2.6 Missed Dose\n\nThe anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of warfarin sodium at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.\n\n# 2.7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery",

The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.\n\n# 2.7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery\n\nSome dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of warfarin sodium therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing warfarin sodium even for a short period of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2.8 Conversion From Other Anticoagulants\n\n# Heparin\n\nSince the full anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium is not achieved for several days, heparin is preferred for initial rapid anticoagulation. During initial therapy with warfarin sodium, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance. Conversion to warfarin sodium may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation, continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap warfarin sodium therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until warfarin sodium has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR, at which point heparin may be discontinued.\n\nAs heparin may affect the INR, patients receiving both heparin and warfarin sodium should have INR monitoring at least:\n\n- 5 hours after the last intravenous bolus dose of heparin, or\n- 4 hours after cessation of a continuous intravenous infusion of heparin, or\n- 24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection.",

Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR >4.0), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], certain concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)], and long duration of warfarin therapy.\n\nPerform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)].\n\nInstruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].\n\n# 5.2 Tissue Necrosis\n\nWarfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (&#x3C;0.1%). Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported.\n\nCareful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.\n\n# 5.3 Calciphylaxis",

When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy.\n\n# 5.4 Acute Kidney Injury\n\nIn patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of kidney disease, acute kidney injury may occur with warfarin sodium, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is advised in patients with compromised renal function.\n\n# 5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli\n\nAnticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as \"purple toes syndrome.\" Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.\n\n# 5.6 Limb Ischemia, Necrosis, and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS\n\nDo not use warfarin sodium as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation.",

While warfarin sodium is contraindicated during pregnancy, the potential benefits of using warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient's medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].\n\n# 5.8 Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks\n\nIn the following clinical settings, the risks of warfarin sodium therapy may be increased:",

Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism.\n\nMore frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [see Boxed Warning].\n\nConsult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding.\n\n# 7.2 CYP450 Interactions\n\nCYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4.

Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Because these data were not collected in adequate and well-controlled studies, this incidence of major birth defects is not an adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U.S. general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. Consider the benefits and risks of warfarin sodium and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing warfarin sodium to a pregnant woman. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\n# Clinical Considerations\n\n# Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions",

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including bleeding in a breastfed infant, consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need for warfarin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from warfarin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition before prescribing warfarin sodium to a lactating woman.\n\n# Clinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for bruising or bleeding.\n\n# Data\n\n# Human Data\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on published data in 15 nursing mothers, warfarin was not detected in human milk. Among the 15 full-term newborns, 6 nursing infants had documented prothrombin times within the expected range. Prothrombin times were not obtained for the other 9 nursing infants. Effects in premature infants have not been evaluated.\n\n# 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential\n\n# Pregnancy Testing\n\nWarfarin sodium can cause fetal harm [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Pediatric use of warfarin sodium is based on adult data and recommendations, and available limited pediatric data from observational studies and patient registries. Pediatric patients administered warfarin sodium should avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury.\n\nThe developing hemostatic system in infants and children results in a changing physiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulants. Dosing of warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age, with infants generally having the highest, and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target INRs. Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age, concomitant medications, diet, and existing medical condition, target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric patients, and more frequent INR determinations are recommended. Bleeding rates varied by patient population and clinical care center in pediatric observational studies and patient registries. Infants and children receiving vitamin K-supplemented nutrition, including infant formulas, may be resistant to warfarin therapy, while human milk-fed infants may be sensitive to warfarin therapy.\n\n# 8.5 Geriatric Use\n\nOf the total number of patients receiving warfarin sodium in controlled clinical trials for which data were available for analysis, 1885 patients (24.4%) were 65 years and older, while 185 patients (2.4%) were 75 years and older.

Reversal of warfarin sodium anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing warfarin sodium therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1. The use of vitamin K1 reduces response to subsequent warfarin sodium therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of warfarin sodium administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of warfarin sodium is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to warfarin sodium overdosage.\n\n# 11 DESCRIPTION\n\nWarfarin sodium tablets contain warfarin sodium, an anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors.

    "text": "# 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n\n# 12.1 Mechanism of Action\n\nWarfarin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which include Factors II, VII, IX, and X, and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Vitamin K promotes the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues in the proteins that are essential for biological activity. Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) enzyme complex, thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K 1epoxide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].\n\n# 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration. However, peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours. The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days. The effects of warfarin sodium may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap. This is consistent with the half-lives of the affected vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and anticoagulation proteins: Factor II - 60 hours, VII - 4 to 6 hours, IX - 24 hours, X - 48 to 72 hours, and proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours, respectively.\n\n# 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\n\nWarfarin sodium is a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers of warfarin. The S-enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R-enantiomer in humans, but generally has a more rapid clearance.\n\n# Absorption\n\nWarfarin is essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with peak concentration generally attained within the first 4 hours.\n\n# Distribution\n\nWarfarin shows a volume of distribution of about 0.14 L/kg. Approximately 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.\n\n# Metabolism",

Approximately 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins.\n\n# Metabolism\n\nThe elimination of warfarin is almost entirely by metabolism. Warfarin is stereoselectively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) microsomal enzymes to inactive hydroxylated metabolites (predominant route) and by reductases to reduced metabolites (warfarin alcohols) with minimal anticoagulant activity. Identified metabolites of warfarin include dehydrowarfarin, two diastereoisomer alcohols, and 4 '-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 10-hydroxywarfarin. The CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme, is likely to be the principal form of human liver CYP450 that modulates the in vivo anticoagulant activity of warfarin. Patients with one or more variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased S-warfarin clearance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].\n\n# Excretion\n\nThe terminal half-life of warfarin after a single dose is approximately 1 week; however, the effective half-life ranges from 20 to 60 hours, with a mean of about 40 hours. The clearance of R-warfarin is generally half that of S-warfarin, thus as the volumes of distribution are similar, the half-life of R-warfarin is longer than that of S-warfarin. The half-life of R-warfarin ranges from 37 to 89 hours, while that of S-warfarin ranges from 21 to 43 hours. Studies with radiolabeled drug have demonstrated that up to 92% of the orally administered dose is recovered in urine. Very little warfarin is excreted unchanged in urine. Urinary excretion is in the form of metabolites.\n\n# Geriatric Patients",

Limited information suggests there is no difference in the clearance of S-warfarin; however, there may be a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlight decrease in the clearance of R-warfarin in the elderly as compared to the young. Therefore, as patient age increases, a lower dose of warfarin is usually required to produce a therapeutic level of anticoagulation (see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)).\n\n# Asian Patients\n\nAsian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin. A non-controlled study of 151 Chinese outpatients stabilized on warfarin for various indications reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3.3 ± 1.4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2.5.

The frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11% and 7% for CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, respectively. Other CYP2C9 alleles associated with reduced enzymatic activity occur at lower frequencies, including *5, *6, and *11 alleles in populations of African ancestry and *5, *9, and *11 alleles in Caucasians.",

When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.\n\nAll problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.\n\nLocal commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.\n\nCommissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.\n\n© NICE 2025.

The difference between the assessment of disease severity and mortality risk score can be important. This guideline uses 3 categories of disease severity: low, moderate and high. Often, but not always, these will match the mortality risk score. Clinical judgement should always be used, as there may be situations when the mortality risk score does not align with the assessment of disease severity.

The committee agreed that home-based care covers a variety of different care models, such as hospital at home service, virtual wards and same-day emergency care (SDEC) units. They noted that the evidence was limited to hospital at home models but agreed that the findings could be extrapolated to other types of home-based care.\n\nThe studies were small, had methodological limitations and included participants not considered to be representative of those who would potentially use virtual wards or hospital at home services. It showed that patients treated at home tended to do no worse than patients treated as inpatients in hospital in terms of hospital re-admission, antibiotic duration, symptom improvement and adverse events. There was insufficient evidence to determine the impact of home-based care on mortality or length of stay.\n\nPatients treated at home were more satisfied with the quality and location of their care. The committee agreed other potential benefits of home-based care such as avoiding deconditioning, reducing the risk of hospital-acquired infection, freeing up hospital beds and reducing demand on acute inpatient services. They noted that home-based care could help avoid hospital admission for people attending primary care or emergency departments.\n\nThe committee discussed the existing recommendations on using CBR65 or CURB65 scores together with clinical judgement, to inform shared decisions about place of care. They agreed they should be retained but added the option to refer to a virtual ward or SDEC unit or hospital at home service. They also identified a list of factors that would need",

They noted that family and carers should be consulted, where appropriate, for example, if they will be involved in supporting the person at home.\n\nThere was no evidence for children, so the committee was not able to make any recommendations about home-based models of care for children and young people.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nMost trusts now have established virtual wards or hospital at home services, so where those services already exist, the recommendations are likely to have a positive impact on reducing hospital admissions and length of hospital stay. This would reduce pressure on hospital inpatient care and potentially free up beds for more severely unwell people who require hospital admission. Early discharge of people who are improving could also improve inpatient capacity.\n\n# Return to recommendations\n\n# Prediction tools for under 18s in primary care\n\n# Why the committee made the recommendation for research\n\nThe evidence was reviewed on risk assessment tools and clinical prediction tools for identifying children and young people attending primary care who may be at risk of deterioration. Recommendations were unable to be developed in this area.\n\nMany children and young people presenting to primary care with respiratory tract infection symptoms will not require antibiotics and can be safely cared for at home. A small number can deteriorate and require secondary care. Identifying those most at risk is important to ensure quick and appropriate referral as well as preventing over-referral to secondary care, so the committee made a recommendation for research on prediction tools for assessing under 18s in primary care with suspected pneumonia.\n\n© NICE 2025.

    "text": "The evidence was reviewed on the prognostic accuracy of the national early warning score 2 (NEWS2) and paediatric early warning system (PEWS) for people with pneumonia. Recommendations were unable to be developed in this area.\n\nThe committee noted that CURB65 is a validated tool that can be used, alongside clinical judgement, to assess the severity of community-acquired pneumonia in hospital. The committee made a recommendation for research to identify or develop tools or methods for stratifying people with hospital-acquired pneumonia according to disease severity. This could include validating an existing model.\n\n# Lung ultrasound\n\n# Recommendation 1.4.2\n\nWhy the committee made the recommendation\n\nEvidence showed that lung ultrasound is a good diagnostic tool for people with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, showing high accuracy for both ruling in and ruling out the diagnosis in symptomatic people. The accuracy of lung ultrasound did not depend on the setting within the hospital where it was used. The evidence was limited to people with community-acquired pneumonia, but the committee agreed that it could be extrapolated to people with hospital-acquired pneumonia.\n\nThe committee discussed the benefits of lung ultrasound compared with chest X-ray, particularly that it avoids radiation exposure and can be used to rapidly consider diagnosis of pneumonia and promptly start antibiotic treatment. Lung ultrasound can be performed at the bedside or point of care during other clinical examinations, which in some situations may be more efficient and less time consuming than transporting someone to the X-ray department and subsequently accessing the images. As such, the committee agreed lung ultrasound may be particularly helpful for initial assessment of a sick or deteriorating person with suspected pneumonia or where several possible causes are being considered for the presenting symptoms.\n\n© NICE 2025.

Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and-conditions#notice-of-rights).\n\n\n\nPneumonia: diagnosis and management (NG250)\n\nLung ultrasound can take longer to perform than chest X-ray and it can be more difficult to visualise the entire lungs, particularly in people who are lying down or in unwell children who are not able to sit still for the time required to complete the examination. Chest X-ray may detect other potential illnesses or problems with the lungs, such as tumours or mediastinal abnormalities. The committee was also concerned about the storage and audit of lung ultrasound images, specifically that it may not be possible to save diagnostic images for later review by other healthcare professionals or for monitoring changes. There was also a discussion about the current lack of trained operators with sufficient experience to perform diagnostic lung ultrasound for pneumonia. The committee agreed that lung ultrasound can be used as a diagnostic tool but should not replace chest X-ray for confirming a diagnosis of pneumonia.\n\n# How the recommendation might affect practice\n\nThe recommendations may increase the use of lung ultrasound beyond current levels, particularly point-of-care use in emergency departments or critical care areas to help inform a diagnosis of pneumonia and promptly start antibiotic treatment. This may mean a quicker diagnosis, starting treatment earlier and enabling assessment of complications.\n\nTo respond to the potential increased use of lung ultrasound, more clinicians will require training and accreditation in this procedure and time to build up experience of this imaging method, which is potentially an implementation issue.\n\n# Return to recommendation\n\n# Biomarkers\n\n# Recommendation 1.4.3 and recommendations 1.11.7 and 1.11.8\n\n# Why the committee made the recommendations\n\nThe evidence showed a link between elevated biomarker levels (C-reactive protein [CRP], procalcitonin [PCT] and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio [NLR]) and adverse outcomes in people with pneumonia. The evidence also showed that patients treated for pneumonia in hospital whose CRP, PCT or NLR levels remained high or increased between admission and day 3 or 4 were more likely to experience adverse clinical outcomes than people whose biomarkers decreased. Although NLR showed a similar pattern of findings to CRP.\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and-conditions#notice-of-rights).",

They concluded that adding admission PCT would not give substantially more information than CRP alone so this would be an unnecessary extra test, with additional cost.\n\nThe committee agreed that CRP or PCT should be measured 3 to 4 days after starting treatment where there is concern about treatment failure. This will allow clinicians to monitor the person's CRP or PCT levels at this time and any changes to their levels if a baseline level has been taken. Low or decreasing levels may help rule out complications or poor prognosis, while high levels, or levels that remain elevated, may help identify when senior clinical review is needed. The committee noted that CRP levels that fail to halve in 3 to 4 days are a cause for concern. They highlighted that both the absolute level of CRP or PCT, as well as any change in levels from baseline to repeat assessment, can be useful. They agreed that patients who are responding well to treatment and whose clinical condition is improving are unlikely to need follow-up biomarker testing.\n\nAdditional evidence compared antibiotic treatment using a PCT-guided algorithm with standard antibiotic treatment and showed that patients treated using the PCT-guided approach took antibiotics for a shorter time and experienced fewer side effects. The reduction in duration of antibiotic treatment did not affect rates of pneumonia recurrence, re-hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or mortality. However, the committee was concerned that the average standard duration of antibiotic treatment used in the trials of 10 to 12 days was much longer than the UK current recommended practice of 5 days. Furthermore, the trials did not give the committee any information on whether it was safe or effective to use PCT levels to reduce antibiotic treatment below 5 days, so they were not able to make a recommendation about this.",

It is mostly seen in people who have been exposed to stagnant water. Exposure to legionella can also occur at the workplace, for example among people who frequently work on air conditioning units. Therefore, they recommended that legionella urinary antigen tests should only be considered if there are risk factors for legionella infection.\n\nFor adults assessed via clinical judgement and CURB65 score as having moderate- or high-severity community-acquired pneumonia, there was evidence to support the use of pneumococcal urinary antigen tests to aid decision making around the selection of the most appropriate antibiotic. This will benefit people with the condition, help improve antimicrobial stewardship and could support de-escalation to a narrower antibiotic spectrum.\n\nThe evidence on pneumococcal urinary antigen tests for babies and children was very limited and mostly not directly applicable to the UK. Based on their expertise, the committee discussed the implications of using urinary antigen tests in babies and children. They made a consensus recommendation not to routinely use these tests for this population as, in their experience, they are not useful in practice.\n\nThere was no evidence identified on mycoplasma testing. The committee discussed this and noted there is limited demand for this test and a positive result may not impact usual antibiotic prescribing decisions, so they did not make a recommendation about this.\n\nThe committee acknowledged that overuse of antibiotics is associated with antimicrobial resistance and is a national and global priority. However, the evidence on how microbiological tests may help reduce rates of empirical prescribing and support more directed antibiotic therapy remains limited. Therefore, they made a recommendation for research into which tests could safely reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing in people with suspected pneumonia.\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

The committee agreed that this did not rule out the possibility of there being a smaller effect of steroids on mortality in line with that suggested by the evidence review, and noted methodological approaches with the trial that led them to be cautious about the findings. Further results on the use of steroids for community-acquired pneumonia are expected in ongoing studies.\n\nThere was a study in the evidence for children. This study did not report the main outcomes of interest, except for adverse events. The committee reflected on the evidence for the use of corticosteroids in adults and discussed the implications of any extrapolation to children. However, given the weak evidence base and limited applicability of the included trials, the committee agreed that this did not currently support a recommendation on the use of corticosteroids for children with pneumonia.\n\nThe committee agreed that further research was needed on use of adjunctive corticosteroid antibiotics in people hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia, including for babies, children and young people. They made a recommendation for research on the effectiveness of corticosteroids including which type, dose and route of administration is most effective and whether effectiveness varied depending on the type of pathogen being treated.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nThe evidence suggests use of corticosteroids is likely to improve outcomes for adults with high-severity community-acquired pneumonia.

They also noted the evidence showed lack of adverse effects and no impact on mortality at 30 days.\n\nBased on the evidence and their expertise and experience, the committee agreed that HFNO was their preferred option because it is less invasive and better tolerated than NIV and CPAP, has fewer safety concerns, and allows the person to eat and drink.\n\nThe committee also agreed the importance of considering the person's clinical trajectory in multidisciplinary team decisions about trialling HFNO. Lay members emphasised the importance of respecting people's preferences, describing the discomfort of NIV and CPAP compared with HFNO.\n\nThe ability of different locations within the hospital to deliver HFNO, CPAP or NIV was discussed.

They agreed that although there can be variation in the time to symptom resolution, for most otherwise healthy children, their symptoms will steadily improve after starting treatment. The committee acknowledged that some symptoms take longer to resolve than parents or carers may expect, particularly cough, which can contribute to unnecessary repeat visits to the GP, so they wanted to reassure parents and carers that cough may persist for up to 4 weeks.\n\nThe committee discussed symptoms that may indicate more serious illnesses or complications. These symptoms include persistent fever, increased work of breathing, and reduced fluid intake or fatigue. They agreed parents or carers should seek further advice if their child continued to present with those symptoms.\n\nGiven the frequency and severity of hospital-acquired pneumonia it would be useful to be able to offer people and their families similarly informed advice. However, searches revealed no evidence to support advice on recovery trajectories in hospital-acquired pneumonia, so no recommendation was made for hospital-acquired pneumonia for parents and carers.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nThe committee agreed that providing parents and carers with information about expected symptom duration in children could reduce unnecessary visits to GPs and other services about symptoms that will resolve with time without the need for further treatment or testing. They also noted that by outlining symptoms that may indicate complications or a deterioration in their child's condition, parents and carers may be better able to identify when they should reconsult a healthcare professional and this may mean their child is seen earlier.

The X-rays took place 4 to 8 weeks after discharge from inpatient care. The evidence showed a cancer detection rate of around 2% and moderate to high rates of pneumonia resolution.\n\nThe committee agreed that the evidence suggested that radiological changes may persist after symptoms of pneumonia have resolved and these do not always indicate a need for further investigation or treatment. As such, offering routine follow-up chest X-rays to all people hospitalised with pneumonia is not always useful for checking if pneumonia has resolved. It was also unclear if it would provide timeliness of cancer detection. The committee noted that the severity of hospital-acquired pneumonia and the frequent association with comorbidities implied that follow-up radiological assessment may be beneficial, but no evidence was available.\n\nThe evidence suggested that people whose follow-up chest X-ray detected cancer were older and had a history of smoking. The committee agreed that smoking or being aged over 50 years are risk factors for lung cancer and other underlying respiratory disease, so follow-up chest imaging should be considered. They agreed that clinicians should also consider follow-up chest X-rays for people with unresolved symptoms or who have unexplained weight loss because these can also be indications of cancer or other underlying conditions.\n\nThe committee discussed that people with hospital-acquired pneumonia may have had recent chest imaging during their admission for non-pneumonia reasons, so there may not be a requirement to perform further chest imaging in this group.

The committee agreed that this research should focus on adult populations only, because the evidence showed that follow-up chest X-rays are not clinically useful for children and young people.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nThese recommendations should reduce the number of chest X-rays required, although a large proportion of people with pneumonia will have the risk factors listed. This would prevent unnecessary investigations and reduce demand on imaging services and associated administration.\n\nReturn to recommendations\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and-conditions#notice-of-rights).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Pneumonia: diagnosis and management (NG250)\n\nContext\n\nIn 2022 a NICE surveillance report identified areas that required updating in NICE's guideline on pneumonia in adults (CG191), particularly around the inclusion of guidance for those under 18 who had been excluded. There were also 2 related NICE antimicrobial prescribing guidelines for both under and over 18s, on community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. This update amalgamates the antimicrobial prescribing guidelines with a partial update of CG191 to provide consolidated pneumonia recommendations.\n\nThe recommendations for pneumonia in children and adults provide guidance on a common respiratory infection that can have a considerable impact both on the individual and on healthcare provision and resources.\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia has an annual incidence of 5 to 10 per 1,000 adult population, and accounts for 5% to 12% of all lower respiratory tract infections managed by GPs in the community. Between 22% and 42% of people with community-acquired pneumonia will require hospital-based care.",

Start treatment within 1 hour if the person has suspected sepsis and meets any of the high-risk criteria for this outlined in the NICE guideline on sepsis.\n\nFor detailed information, see the NICE guideline on managing COVID-19.\n\nSummary of antimicrobial prescribing guidance – managing common infections (March 2022)\n\n\n\n\n# Infection\n\n# Key points\n\n| Medicine                   | Doses                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Length                                   | Visual summary |\n| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- |\n| Acute exacerbation of COPD | First choice: amoxicillin OR doxycycline OR clarithromycin                                                                                                                                                           | 500mg TDS (see BNF for severe infection) | -              |\n|                            | 200mg on day 1, then 100mg OD (see BNF for severe infection)                                                                                                                                                         | -                                        | -              |\n|                            | Second choice: use alternative first choice                                                                                                                                                                          | 500mg BD                                 | -              |\n|                            | Alternative choice (if person at higher risk of treatment failure): co-amoxiclav OR co-trimoxazole OR levofloxacin (with specialist advice if co-amoxiclav or co-trimoxazole cannot be used; consider safety issues) | 960mg BD                                 | -              |\n|                            | 500mg OD                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 5 days                                   | -              |\n|                            | IV antibiotics (click on visual summary)                                                                                                                                                                             | -                                        | -              |",

For adults, consider seeking prompt specialist advice from a microbiologist or infectious diseases specialist before starting treatment. For children and young people, treatment should be started by, or after advice from, a microbiologist, paediatric infectious diseases specialist or paediatric gastroenterologist. If antibiotics have been started for suspected C. difficile infection, and subsequent stool sample tests do not confirm infection, consider stopping these antibiotics.

If candida possible, use imidazole. If intractable, or scalp: send skin scrapings, and if infection confirmed: use oral terbinafine or itraconazole. Scalp: oral therapy, and discuss with specialist.\n\n# Last updated:\n\nFeb 2019\n\n# Dermatophyte infection: nail\n\nTake nail clippings; start therapy only if infection is confirmed. Oral terbinafine is more effective than oral azole. Liver reactions 0.1 to 1% with oral antifungals. If candida or non-dermatophyte infection is confirmed, use oral itraconazole. Topical nail lacquer is not as effective. To prevent recurrence: apply weekly 1% topical antifungal cream to entire toe area.

When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.\n\nAll problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.\n\nLocal commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.\n\nCommissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.\n\n© NICE 2025.

They agreed that no tool is very good at accurately discriminating between who will and who will not have a CVD event, but that tools are useful for guiding decisions about interventions to prevent CVD based on estimated risk.\n\nA small amount of evidence suggested that the additional fields included in QRISK3 (such as severe mental illness, regular corticosteroid use and atypical antipsychotic use) enabled the tool to perform better than QRISK2 at predicting CVD events for people with these risk factors. Use of QRISK3 should, therefore, result in more people within these groups being appropriately considered for risk reduction approaches including statin treatment.\n\nIt was noted that the group of people with severe mental illness used to develop and validate QRISK3 included a high proportion of people with severe and moderate depression. This is reflected in the definition of severe mental illness in QRISK3 but does not reflect the definition used in electronic clinical systems in primary care. The committee agreed, informed by their clinical experience and expert opinion, that people with moderate to severe depression are not considered to have as great an increased risk of CVD as people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses. By using data that grouped these conditions together, QRISK3 may underestimate CVD risk for people with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses. Despite this the committee agreed to recommend use of the tool for people with severe mental illness (however defined), but clinical judgement should inform interpretation.\n\n© NICE 2025.

If the individual discloses gender reassignment, they should be provided with CVD risk calculations based on both genders and advised to discuss with their GP which calculation is most appropriate for them as an individual. They agreed that healthcare professionals are expected to follow this guidance when undertaking formal risk assessments.\n\nAn age range is given for QRISK3 because it is only intended for people aged between 25 and 84 years (inclusive).\n\nThe committee agreed that the use of a risk tool remains appropriate in people with type 2 diabetes to support shared decision making. They agreed, based on the evidence, that QRISK3 performed better than QRISK2 for the population as a whole and so should be used for people with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe committee agreed to remove a 2014 recommendation to complete as many fields of the risk assessment tool as possible because QRISK3 explains that the tool can overestimate risk if fields are left blank. They also noted that BMI, ethnicity and family history of CVD should be recorded in people's medical records, so the committee agreed that the 2014 recommendation on recording this information was no longer needed.\n\nEvidence on the performance of QRISK3 was not considered sufficient to suggest changing the 2014 recommendations against using a CVD risk tool in people with type 1 diabetes or CKD as it had not been validated in a separate population from that in which the tool was developed. The committee agreed these groups should be considered high risk, as should people with familial hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nBased on their clinical experience, the committee identified a list of factors for which all CVD risk tools underestimate risk. They highlighted the importance of using clinical judgement to interpret risk scores. As risk scores are used to guide decisions about interventions to prevent CVD, the committee agreed it was particularly important to ensure people are not incorrectly considered to be at low risk.\n\nThe 2014 recommendation to consider people aged 85 and older to be at increased risk of CVD was retained as the committee agreed with this statement and there are still no tools for this age group. The committee highlighted it is important that this group be considered for interventions to prevent CVD even though a formal risk assessment would not be carried out.",

However, the committee agreed they can have value in communication of risk. See the section on communication about risk assessment, lifestyle changes and treatment.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nQRISK2 is currently integrated into electronic clinical systems, so 10-year CVD risk assessments can be generated using data already available in a person's electronic records. At the time of development, the committee was aware of ongoing discussions about continuation of the inclusion of QRISK in electronic clinical systems.\n\nUsing QRISK3 instead of QRISK2 will require clinical systems to be updated by software developers for the impact on practice to be minimised. Public Health England issued guidance in August 2021 on using QRISK3 in NHS health checks and how to deal with the transition period (responsibility for the NHS Health Check programme has transferred to the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, but the guidance produced by Public Health England remains current).\n\nQRISK3 requires some additional clinical information that was not required for QRISK2. However, if integrated into electronic clinical systems, QRISK3 is not likely to require additional resources over QRISK2. There may be some implementation costs as healthcare professionals become familiar with the additional information included in QRISK3 and in managing the transition period.\n\n# Return to recommendations\n\n# Communication about risk assessment, lifestyle changes and treatment\n\n# Recommendation 1.1.16\n\n# Why the committee made the recommendation\n\nThe committee agreed that the evidence did not support using lifetime CVD risk assessment tools to guide decisions on the need for statin treatment because their accuracy could not be reliably assessed.\n\n© NICE 2025.

They agreed by consensus that lifetime risk tools should be considered to help inform discussions about risk and motivate lifestyle changes. The committee highlighted that these tools may underestimate the ongoing benefit of lipid-lowering treatments as they do not predict risk reduction from taking medicines, and noted this should be considered when interpreting the results. They agreed lifetime risk calculation would not be necessary for everyone, but it may be particularly useful for people with a QRISK3 score less than 10% or under 40s who have CVD risk factors.\n\n# How the recommendation might affect practice\n\nLifetime risk tools are not routinely used in current clinical practice. The committee noted that there may be resource implications for calculating lifetime risk score estimates because lifetime risk tools are not currently embedded into electronic clinical systems, so scores are not automatically generated. There may also be implementation costs related to educating healthcare professionals about lifetime risk calculators. It is not clear if use of lifetime risk tools will result in longer consultations.\n\nThe committee agreed that the online calculators for lifetime risk tools such as QRISK-lifetime were easy to complete and provided some interpretation of the risk scores to aid discussions, but acknowledged that lifetime risk assessment would not be done for everyone.\n\nThe committee believe that using lifetime risk tools may have a long-term benefit in encouraging people to participate in lifestyle changes or engage in treatment, if appropriate.

Evidence on the risk of muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis with statin use demonstrated a real effect, but the large body of evidence showed this was a very small increased risk when compared with similar populations not on statins; that is, when using high-intensity statins approximately 16% of people reported experiencing muscle pain, but of these cases only around 1 in 12 were likely to be due to the statin.\n\nThe committee agreed to strengthen the recommendation to reassure people that the risk of these adverse effects occurring is low.\n\nThe evidence supported the other 2014 recommendations, so they were retained. The committee agreed a full lipid profile should be provided before starting statins and amended the recommendation on lipid measures accordingly. See the section on assessing response to treatment for further details.\n\nHow the recommendations might affect practice\n\nThe recommendation on adverse effects has been strengthened to emphasise the low risk of experiencing severe muscle adverse effects because of statin treatment.

The majority of people in the trials were also taking statins.\n\nModest reductions in major CVD events such as myocardial infarction, stroke and related deaths were also seen for all 4 medicines. The committee recognised that some of the trials involved short follow-up periods of 1 year or less, so these medicines are likely to have a bigger impact on CVD events over the long term. There was no clinically important increased risk of adverse events. Injection site reactions were more frequent with alirocumab, evolocumab and inclisiran than with placebo but these were mild and not persistent.\n\nAn economic model was developed using estimates of the impact of lipid-lowering treatments on LDL cholesterol (from a network meta-analysis of the 34 RCTs), combined with estimates of the impact of LDL cholesterol reduction on major cardiovascular events (from a published meta-analysis of statin RCTs). The economic model calculated, for all possible baseline LDL cholesterol levels, the reduced admissions to hospital for stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular procedures and the associated life expectancy increases, quality of life improvements and treatment cost savings as a result of taking lipid-lowering treatments. This was offset against the cost of lipid-lowering treatments and associated monitoring costs.

The committee decided that 2.0 mmol per litre was likely to be cost effective and would allow more people to be treated than 2.2 mmol per litre.\n\nEven though the main economic analysis was based on the impact of lipid-lowering treatment on LDL cholesterol levels, the committee recognised the need to identify a non-HDL cholesterol target for use when LDL cholesterol levels have not been requested or calculated.\n\nUsing the distribution of LDL cholesterol levels for the population with CVD and on a statin in the clinical practice research datalink (CPRD) dataset, 42% of people had LDL cholesterol levels of 2.0 mmol per litre or more. Using the same data, the threshold for non-HDL cholesterol that would produce an identical number of people being escalated for treatment was 2.6 mmol per litre. An alternative approach would be to use the Friedewald equation and insert the mean triglyceride level of 1.4 mmol per litre along with the LDL cholesterol of 2.0 mmol per litre. This approach also indicates a non-HDL cholesterol target of 2.6 mmol per litre.\n\nBoth target measures are slightly higher than other national and international targets because, unlike other targets, the LDL cholesterol target is based on the cost effectiveness of treatment escalation. However, the committee thought it was sufficiently similar and, because it was more affordable, was more likely to be implemented.\n\n# Statin plus ezetimibe",

Ezetimibe was cost effective regardless of LDL cholesterol, so the committee agreed that it could be considered for people with lipid levels below the agreed target. They noted that the trade-off between further reducing risk and increasing medication should be taken into account. These should be considered and fully discussed with the person as part of informed shared decision making. Furthermore, the committee agreed that adherence may be lower for people on 2 pills rather than 1, especially if they are below the target.\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

They highlighted the importance of reviewing statin medication in response to adverse effects before deciding someone is statin intolerant.\n\nAn economic analysis estimated the absolute LDL cholesterol target at which it was cost effective to escalate treatment for people on ezetimibe who are statin intolerant. The analysis explored different combinations of lipid-lowering treatments.\n\nThe committee discussed whether the lipid target should be different because of the different treatment options and associated costs. However, it was noted that this may introduce inequality regarding access to lipid-lowering treatment. Also, the target at which escalation of lipid-lowering treatment is cost effective did not change when the statin intolerant population was included in the economic model alongside the statin tolerant population, largely because the prevalence of statin intolerance is relatively low. Therefore, the committee agreed that the target for people who cannot take statins should be the same as for those who can take them.",

    "text": "# Diagnosing hypertension\n\n# Recommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.5 and 1.2.8\n\n# Why the committee made the recommendations\n\nOverall, there was limited new evidence on the accuracy of different methods of measuring blood pressure. Most of the studies identified were small, and the populations and protocols for measurement varied making interpretation difficult. However, the committee agreed that it was important to focus on the evidence from these more recent studies (post-2000) because the evidence should reflect the current use of electronic sphygmomanometers, which have replaced mercury-based sphygmomanometers.\n\nThe evidence did not show that changing the current blood pressure thresholds for clinic measurement or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) would improve diagnostic accuracy compared with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), so the committee agreed the 2011 thresholds for diagnosis should be retained. The committee noted that these are in line with most international guidance.\n\nLimited evidence suggested that clinic blood pressure measurement is less accurate than HBPM or ABPM when used to diagnose hypertension. The committee members acknowledged that these findings were in line with their clinical experience and agreed that clinic blood pressure measurement alone would not be an adequate method to diagnose hypertension.\n\nThe committee discussed repeat clinic blood pressure measurements when there is a difference in blood pressure between arms and noted that clinical practice varied. Based on their experience and knowledge, the committee members agreed that a cut-off of 15 mmHg would be more suitable than 20 mmHg, which was specified in the 2011 recommendations. This is in line with recent evidence that suggests a small difference in\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management (NG136)\n\narm blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, possibly due to vascular damage.\n\nABPM correlates well with invasive blood pressure measurement and can identify both white-coat and masked hypertension. Based on the evidence in the 2011 guideline and the committee's experience and knowledge, it was agreed that ABPM remains the gold standard for the accurate measurement of blood pressure in primary care. ABPM has therefore been retained as the preferred method for the diagnosis of hypertension. In addition, economic evidence obtained by updating the health economic model for the 2011 guideline confirmed that ABPM is still likely to be the most cost-effective method for diagnosis, even with the inclusion of new data for improved accuracy of home and clinic measurement.\n\nThe evidence showed that validated HBPM is an accurate method of diagnosing hypertension for people in sinus rhythm. The committee's experience in clinical practice supported this, and the committee agreed that it is a suitable alternative when ABPM is unsuitable or not tolerated. The committee noted that the British and Irish Hypertension Society maintains a list of validated blood pressure devices for home use. The British and Irish Hypertension Society is an independent reviewer of published work and this does not imply any endorsement of specific devices by NICE.\n\nThe evidence did not suggest that there were any benefits of adding telemonitoring to HBPM. Therefore, the committee agreed that it could not make a recommendation on telemonitoring for the diagnosis of hypertension.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nThe recommendations reinforce current good practice. However, the committee noted that implementation of the 2011 recommendations on ABPM has been challenging and that there is still variation in practice. A change in practice and additional resources and training will be needed in areas where there is currently no access to ABPM devices. However, ABPM was found to be the most cost-effective method of diagnosis, and it is anticipated that the long-term benefits of accurate diagnosis and treatment (such as avoiding over diagnosis and unnecessary treatment) will outweigh any initial costs.\n\nReturn to recommendations\n\n© NICE 2025.

    "text": "Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management (NG136)\n\n# Relaxation therapies\n\n# Why the committee deleted the recommendation on relaxation therapies\n\nThe evidence on relaxation therapies was limited to a single small study. The study suggested some benefit in reducing angina and myocardial infarction, but it also suggested an increase in stroke. The committee agreed that the study was not adequate to assess the effectiveness of these therapies or to make a recommendation.\n\nThe 2011 guideline stated that relaxation therapies could reduce blood pressure, but it did not recommend their routine use in practice. The committee noted that this was based on evidence for reducing blood pressure only, and there was no evidence of a direct benefit to people with hypertension, such as improving quality of life or reducing cardiovascular events. The committee agreed there was insufficient evidence of benefit to recommend that people pursue this option themselves and agreed to remove this recommendation. It is not the intention of the committee to stop people from trying relaxation therapies if they wish to, but to make people aware that there is less evidence for benefit of this intervention compared with other lifestyle interventions or pharmacological treatment. The committee agreed that the clinical focus for non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension should be on encouraging people to make lifestyle changes, such as taking regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nThe committee agreed that further research would be useful to determine whether relaxation therapies are a clinically effective treatment for hypertension in terms of reducing cardiovascular events or improving quality of life (see the recommendation for research on relaxation therapies). They also noted that a larger study would be needed to obtain meaningful results.\n\n# How this might affect practice\n\nRelaxation therapies were not recommended for routine use in the 2011 guideline, and they are not used in current practice for the management of primary hypertension in adults. The 2011 recommendation advised that people may try them as part of their treatment to reduce blood pressure, but committee consensus was that uptake has been low. Therefore, current practice will not be affected by the removal of the 2011 recommendation.\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management (NG136)\n\n# Starting antihypertensive drug treatment\n\n# Recommendations 1.4.9 to 1.4.14\n\n# Why the committee made the recommendations\n\nThe evidence suggested that antihypertensive drug treatment was effective at reducing cardiovascular events in people with a clinic blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg or more (stage 2 hypertension).\n\nA large study also suggested there was benefit of treating people with stage 1 hypertension. However, other studies in people with a low cardiovascular risk did not identify a benefit of treatment, and the committee agreed that the benefit of treatment across different cardiovascular risk groups was uncertain. The evidence was used to develop an economic model to compare the cost effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment with no treatment in people with stage 1 hypertension at different levels of cardiovascular risk. For people aged 60, the model showed that treatment was cost effective at a 10-year cardiovascular risk level of 10%, but there was some uncertainty at around 5% risk. Further analysis showed that it was cost effective to offer antihypertensive treatment to people aged 40 and 50 with stage 1 hypertension at a 5% risk and aged 70 and 75 at a 10% or 15% risk. QRISK was specified as the risk tool because it is recommended by NICE for risk calculation and most likely to be used in practice.\n\nTaking into account the evidence and the results of the model, the committee were confident that people under 80 with stage 1 hypertension and a cardiovascular risk above 10% should have a discussion with their healthcare professional about starting antihypertensive treatment, alongside lifestyle changes, and that this would be a clinically and cost-effective use of NHS resources. The committee also agreed that antihypertensive treatment should be considered for people under 60 with a risk below 10%, with the degree of uncertainty in treating people at low risk reflected in the strength of the recommendation.\n\nThe committee members were mindful of the additional population that would be affected by lowering the threshold and were aware that the decision to start drug treatment would depend on the person's preferences and their individual risk of cardiovascular disease. The recommendations highlight the importance of discussing the person's preferences for treatment and encouraging lifestyle changes.\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and-conditions#notice-of-rights).\n\n\n\nHypertension in adults: diagnosis and management (NG136)\n\nSome studies investigated the benefits of treating hypertension in people with lower cardiovascular risk or people with blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. However, some of these studies were not directly relevant because they included a high proportion of participants with chronic kidney disease and previous cardiovascular events. For this reason, several studies could not be used to inform the recommendations. For details of these studies see evidence review C: initiating treatment.\n\nThe committee discussed the lack of evidence to inform a threshold for starting treatment in people aged under 40. It was agreed that this is an important area for future research and the recommendation for research was carried forward from the 2011 guideline (see the recommendation for research on thresholds for interventions in adults aged under 40).\n\nThe committee agreed that there was no evidence to suggest that thresholds for starting treatment should be different in people with type 2 diabetes. The previous recommendations for people with type 2 diabetes (in NICE's guideline on type 2 diabetes in adults) suggested starting antihypertensive drug treatment if lifestyle interventions alone did not reduce blood pressure to below 140/80 mmHg or 130/80 mmHg in the presence of kidney, cerebrovascular or eye disease. However, this was based on evidence from 2 small studies in which the participants did not have hypertension. Further evidence for lower treatment thresholds in people with type 2 diabetes was limited within this review, with the committee aware of some evidence to suggest that lower blood pressure thresholds did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events in people without additional risk factors. The committee therefore agreed that there was insufficient evidence to recommend a different threshold for starting treatment for this subgroup.\n\nThere was no evidence identified on thresholds for people aged over 80, and no prior recommendation for this age group with hypertension below stage 2; therefore, the committee agreed that the threshold for starting treatment in people aged over 80 should be consistent with the target for treatment in this population (150/90 mmHg or lower).",

It is difficult to predict the extent of the impact because there is variability in how the 2011 recommendation with a threshold of 20% is being implemented in practice. However, it is believed, based on some recently published UK data, that potentially around 50% of people with stage 1 hypertension and risk below 20% are already being treated with antihypertensive drugs (Association of guideline and policy changes with incidence of lifestyle advice and treatment for uncomplicated mild hypertension in primary care. Sheppard et al. 2018).\n\nPeople with stage 1 hypertension should already be monitored every year, but reducing the threshold will increase the number of people being prescribed antihypertensive drugs and increase staff time and consultations involved in starting and monitoring their drug treatment. However, there will be a reduction in cardiovascular events resulting in savings, although it is acknowledged that the costs and savings may fall in different sectors of the NHS.\n\n# Return to recommendations\n\n# Monitoring treatment and blood pressure targets\n\n# Recommendations 1.4.15 to 1.4.22\n\n# Monitoring treatment\n\n# Why the committee made the recommendations",

The evidence on monitoring was limited, with relatively small studies comparing different combinations of HBPM (with or without telemonitoring and with or without pharmacist input), pharmacy monitoring and clinic monitoring. It suggested that people had improved blood pressure control with HBPM with telemonitoring, with or without pharmacy input, compared with clinic monitoring, and the greatest blood pressure reduction was achieved with pharmacist input.

The committee discussed the importance of patient choice and agreed that home monitoring should be an option, if it is suitable and the person is willing and motivated to use it. HBPM is already widely used in practice, especially for people with a white-coat effect. The committee agreed this would be reflected in the recommendation supported by the evidence and consensus opinion.

The committee discussed concerns about the population included in the study and the applicability to UK practice of the methods used. The study used automated blood pressure devices with a time delay and an isolated rest period, which is not common practice in the UK. The committee considered that the use of these devices would lead to lower blood pressure readings than in routine UK clinical practice. They also had concerns that some medicines were stopped when blood pressure targets were achieved, which may have had an impact on the results. The committee also discussed concerns about applicability of the population; for example, the participants had high cardiovascular risk levels, including many with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or renal impairment, and were already receiving treatment before the study started. These concerns made the evidence difficult to interpret and use to inform the recommendations. Further details of the committee's discussion of this study is included in evidence review D: targets.\n\nEvidence from a smaller study also showed some benefit of lowering clinic systolic blood pressure targets to 130 mmHg. However, the committee noted that the study was based on people already receiving treatment and that it lacked information on adverse events.\n\nThe committee agreed that there was no evidence to suggest that blood pressure targets should be different in people with type 2 diabetes. Evidence for lower targets in people with type 2 diabetes was also limited, with some evidence to suggest that lower blood pressure targets did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events.

    "text": "Overall, the committee agreed that the evidence was unclear and insufficient to determine whether a lower target would be beneficial and whether it would outweigh the associated harms. Therefore, the 2011 clinic blood pressure target of 140/90 mmHg for adults under 80 years was retained and applies to people with or without type 2 diabetes. The corresponding HBPM and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) targets were also retained at 135/85 mmHg. The recommendations emphasise the importance of achieving and maintaining a level consistently below the person's blood pressure target, whether this target be based on clinic blood pressure, HBPM or ABPM.\n\nBased on their experience, the committee members felt that people with postural hypotension are at risk of adverse events if a sitting or lying blood pressure is used for monitoring, because this measurement would overestimate daytime blood pressure and result in overtreatment. For example, a patient with a sitting systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg might have a much lower blood pressure when standing and be at an increased risk of falls if treated based on their sitting blood pressure. The committee decided to recommend that 3 groups who are at risk of postural hypotension (people over 80 years, with type 2 diabetes and with symptoms of postural hypotension) should have their standing blood pressure measured, and their treatment modified accordingly if they have postural hypotension. The standing blood pressure should be used for future monitoring.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nThe recommendations should reinforce current good practice. However, the new recommendations place more emphasis on maintaining blood pressure consistently below the blood pressure targets. As a result, this could lead to a higher use of antihypertensive drugs and an increase in consultations to maintain target blood pressure. For people with type 2 diabetes and target organ damage (not covered by other guidelines), the slightly higher target blood pressure compared to that recommended previously may reduce adverse events and may lead to fewer appointments and reduced drug use.\n\nReturn to recommendations\n\n© NICE 2025.

    "text": "Despite the lack of evidence formally reviewed, the committee discussed the recommendation based on their clinical experience, taking the 2011 recommendations into account. The committee agreed that although the evidence for spironolactone did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the updated review for the guideline because the key study had a very short follow up and did not report any of the cardiovascular outcomes specified in this review protocol, the use of an aldosterone antagonist is now common clinical practice. Therefore, there was no reason to suggest that this recommendation should be changed.\n\nIn the 2011 guideline, high-dose thiazide diuretics were recommended as a potential step 4 treatment in people with high blood potassium levels. The committee felt that there was a lack of evidence for this approach and noted that the studies did not show an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes at higher doses, albeit in people without resistant hypertension. The committee agreed that the recommendation for considering alpha- or beta-blockers should be retained based on significant clinical experience of their safe and effective use and because adding a further drug is likely to have a greater effect on blood pressure than increasing the thiazide diuretic dose.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nThe recommendations represent current good practice and so should not change practice. High-dose thiazide diuretics are not commonly used as step 4 therapy and so removing this should not change practice.\n\nThere might be a small reduction in step 4 treatment with more thorough checks to confirm resistant hypertension. However, this may also result in an increase in blood pressure measurements to appropriately confirm resistant hypertension where this is not.\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

    "text": "The committee noted that it can be difficult to differentiate between accelerated hypertension and severe hypertension. They discussed the advantages and disadvantages of broader criteria for same-day referral, which would increase referrals to hospital but reduce the risk of missing people who need urgent treatment. The committee decided it would be beneficial to add some emergency symptoms to the existing recommendation, which will help healthcare professionals to decide when to refer.\n\nBased on their experience, the committee members agreed that some people with severe hypertension could be receiving unnecessary treatment because the 2011 guideline recommended treatment based on severe hypertension alone. The committee agreed that this could be prevented if investigations for target organ damage were carried out quickly before offering treatment in people with severely raised blood pressure and no other symptoms of concern. The committee also agreed that checking blood pressure again within 7 days in people with no target organ damage would ensure that people with severe hypertension are followed up and offered suitable treatment.\n\nThe committee agreed that further research is needed in this area, particularly for people with extreme hypertension (220/120 mmHg or higher) or emergency symptoms.

However, the number of people started on treatment immediately may be reduced because of undertaking investigations first.\n\nThe population with severe hypertension is very small, and the proportion with severe hypertension and additional symptoms that suggest accelerated hypertension is even smaller; therefore, resource impact is unlikely to be substantial.\n\nReturn to recommendations\n\n© NICE 2025.

    "text": "Hypertension in adults: diagnosis and management (NG136)\n\n# Context\n\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most important, treatable causes of premature morbidity and mortality in the world. It is a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cognitive decline and premature death. In 2015, it was reported that high blood pressure affected more than 1 in 4 adults in England (31% of men; 26% of women) – around 13.5 million people – and contributed to 75,000 deaths. The clinical management of hypertension accounts for 12% of visits to primary care and up to £2.1 billion of healthcare expenditure. Managing the cardiovascular events caused by hypertension also consumes considerable resources.\n\nThe guideline covers adults (over 18 years) with suspected or diagnosed hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes.\n\n# 2019 update\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, progress has been made to improve the diagnosis and management of hypertension: the population average blood pressure in England has fallen by about 3 mmHg systolic and the proportion of adults with untreated high blood pressure has decreased. However, the Public Health England Blood Pressure Action Plan called for further action to reduce the population average blood pressure by 5 mmHg through improved prevention, detection and management (Public Health England's Tackling high blood pressure: from evidence into action, 2015 and Tackling high blood pressure: an update, 2018).\n\nSince the publication of the 2011 NICE guideline on hypertension, new studies have been published in key areas of management; in particular, the optimal method and threshold for diagnosis of hypertension, managing blood pressure in lower risk populations and reducing blood pressure to lower targets in people with hypertension (including those with type 2 diabetes). The updated guideline makes new recommendations in these areas, based on the evidence, that aim to improve care and reduce variation in current practice.\n\nTreating resistant hypertension (when more than 3 drugs are needed to treat hypertension) remains challenging. New data was also reviewed in this area and the recommendations updated.\n\nThere is uncertainty in current practice about which people with symptomatic very high\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

[2015]\n\n# Why this is important\n\nThere is a lack of evidence on the effects of stopping and/or switching drug treatments to control blood glucose levels. The current practice of 'stopping rules' is typically motivated by either inadequate blood glucose control (rising HbA1c levels) or intolerable side effects. There is limited understanding of the short- and long-term effects of stopping a therapy and switching to another in terms of diabetes control (HbA1c levels), hypoglycaemic risk, weight gain, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, there is limited understanding of how quickly consideration should be given to stopping and switching to another drug treatment and, if stopping and switching may be needed, what the optimal sequencing is of drug treatments. Randomised controlled trials examining these different issues would help to improve diabetes care.\n\n# 2.

To date, research evidence has largely focused on metformin-based treatment combinations. Given the progressive nature of the condition, in which intensification of blood glucose lowering drug therapies are indicated over time, there is little evidence, for some adults, to guide management strategies on treatment combinations that do not include metformin. Randomised controlled trials are therefore needed to better understand the treatment choices that are available which improve blood glucose control and long-term risks of complications associated with diabetes.\n\n# 3 Drug treatment for when blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin combinations\n\nWhen blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin combinations, which blood glucose lowering therapies should be used to control blood glucose levels? [2015, amended 2021]\n\nWhy this is important\n\nAs the incidence of type 2 diabetes increases in the younger population and as blood glucose control declines naturally over time, it is likely that further intensification of therapies would be needed. Currently, there is evidence up to second intensification of drug therapies, that is, when 2 or more non-insulin-based treatment combinations fail to adequately control blood glucose levels. Randomised controlled trials are needed to improve understanding of alternative treatment options for adults at second intensification whose blood glucose is inadequately controlled with insulin and/or triple non-insulin-based drug therapies.\n\n# 4 Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels\n\nWhat is the optimal frequency for self-monitoring of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes?

They were aware of examples from current practice in which adults who have insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and use intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) have had good outcomes. Because of the additional cost associated with CGM and the large number of adults with type 2 diabetes, the committee used both the evidence and their clinical experience to decide who would gain the most benefit from using CGM.\n\nThere was evidence that intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) was cost effective for adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin, but no evidence for populations not using insulin, so the committee agreed to restrict their recommendations to that subpopulation.\n\nPeople who have recurrent or severe hypoglycaemic events were identified as one of the groups likely to benefit most from isCGM, because hypoglycaemic events were considered to be one of the most important and concerning outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes who are using insulin. The committee decided that the number of hypoglycaemic events was a more effective indicator of someone who would benefit from isCGM than specific HbA1c target values, because target values can vary between people. The evidence also indicated minimal effects of isCGM on HbA1c values.",

All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and-conditions#notice-of-rights).\n\n\n\nType 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)\n\nPeople who use insulin and have a condition or disability that restricts their ability to self-monitor blood glucose levels should also be offered isCGM. This is because having access to isGCM means they will no longer have to rely on others to monitor their diabetes, potentially increasing their independence. For people with learning disabilities, this recommendation is in line with similar guidance for type 1 diabetes set out in the NHS RightCare Pathway, which specifies reasonable adjustments for people with a learning disability who have diabetes.\n\nPeople who are advised to self-measure using capillary blood glucose monitoring more than 8 times a day should also be offered isCGM. This is in line with the funding requirements for NHS England's flash glucose monitoring: national arrangements for funding of relevant diabetes patients. Although the funding requirements are specifically for people with type 1 diabetes, the committee thought that this criterion was also important for people with type 2 diabetes who have to monitor their blood glucose levels multiple times a day.\n\nPeople who need help from a care worker or other healthcare professional to administer their insulin injections should also be offered isCGM, even if they only use once-daily insulin injections. isCGM will help care workers to record a person's blood glucose levels quickly. And for people who have multiple home care visits per day, blood glucose levels can be recorded at each visit. This will help them to adjust their insulin levels to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemic events between home visits. It may also reduce the number of hospital admissions for this group.\n\nThe committee discussed how short-term use of isCGM may still be useful for some people. It may help people to understand when they have hypoglycaemic episodes, which would help them to develop a more effective treatment plan.",

They noted, however, that prices of rtCGM have reduced over the past few years, and if this continues to happen there may come a time when it is no more expensive than isCGM. At this point, rtCGM would be an appropriate alternative for people who meet the criteria for isCGM.\n\nThe committee did not make a recommendation on using specific devices because CGM technologies are changing very quickly and this recommendation would soon be out of date.

The ability to self-monitor blood glucose levels allows people to ensure the accuracy of the CGM device. The committee also recommended keeping capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up for situations such as when the technology fails.\n\nThe committee decided to highlight that CGM should be provided by a team who have expertise in its use. To ensure that CGM is effective, healthcare professionals need to have the skills to interpret and communicate the data effectively. As well as healthcare professionals having a clear understanding of CGM, it is also crucial that people with type 2 diabetes who are using CGM have education about the technology. This will increase the likelihood that people will scan and report the results frequently, allowing people to understand and manage their diabetes effectively.\n\nAlthough many people will choose CGM if offered, there are some people who either cannot be offered it or do not want to use it. Because it is still important for these people to monitor their blood glucose levels, the committee made a recommendation to reinforce the importance of offering capillary blood glucose monitoring instead.",

Using CGM for a short period of time may help some people to understand when they have hypoglycaemic episodes, thereby helping them to develop a more effective treatment plan.\n\nDespite the positive recommendations on CGM, the committee were concerned that existing health inequalities may still lead to lower uptake of CGM in some groups of people. To address this, the committee made a recommendation outlining actions for commissioners, providers and healthcare professionals.\n\nThe committee highlighted the importance of routinely reviewing a person's use of CGM.

Therefore, they retained the 2015 recommendations outlining the drug treatment options for people in the lower risk group.\n\n# Assessing cardiovascular status\n\nThe committee agreed it was important to assess people's cardiovascular status and risk to help determine which treatments are suitable for them. They used a definition for the established cardiovascular disease group (adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) that reflected the people included in all the clinical trials and modelled as a subgroup in the economic model.\n\nTo assess whether people are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the committee recommended using the QRISK3 tool because this is recommended in NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification for adults with type 2 diabetes, and the factors covered by this tool were similar to those used in the trials and economic model to define this population. In addition, this tool is widely used in current practice in the NHS.\n\nLifetime cardiovascular risk may be underestimated in people aged under 40 using this tool, so the committee also included risk factors to consider for this age group. This definition was broadly aligned to the subgroup of people with high cardiovascular risk without established cardiovascular disease who were included in the model.\n\n# Choosing an SGLT2 inhibitor with cardiovascular benefit",

So, they recommended dual therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit in addition to metformin for both groups, but only as an option to consider for people without established cardiovascular disease, to reflect the lower certainty. For people without a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease who do not have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, metformin monotherapy remains the recommended first-line treatment option, based on the 2015 recommendation.\n\nWhen starting first-line dual therapy, the committee noted the importance of introducing the drugs sequentially. This enables any side effects and intolerances from the first drug to be identified before the second drug is introduced. In line with current practice, the committee recommended starting with metformin and then adding the SGLT2 inhibitor without delay once metformin tolerability is established, to avoid people remaining on metformin alone for prolonged periods.\n\nSome people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor.

The committee therefore prioritised this class of drugs for these people. As before, there was greater certainty in the results for people with established cardiovascular disease compared with those at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and the rationale for referring to SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit also applies here.\n\nSome people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor or metformin. There was no evidence specifically for this group so the committee made the same assumption as above (that these people would take the next most effective and cost-effective treatment). The committee did not recommend a specific drug for these people because GLP-1 mimetics were not cost-effective options in this situation (see the rationale and impact section on why GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment). They agreed that in practice prescribers would use their clinical judgement to choose an appropriate treatment from the remaining options, based on the individual clinical circumstances and needs of the person with type 2 diabetes (see recommendation 1.7.1).\n\n# Safety considerations for SGLT2 inhibitors\n\nThe committee noted some particularly important safety considerations to take into account before an adult with type 2 diabetes starts on an SGLT2 inhibitor. The committee highlighted these because the SGLT2 inhibitors are comparatively new drugs and clinical experience with them is low in primary care, but the new recommendations are expected to greatly increase their use in this setting. In the committee's experience there have been multiple instances of avoidable diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resulting in hospital admission. The committee highlighted some factors that might put someone at higher risk of DKA, but the list is not intended to be exhaustive. Addressing modifiable risk factors before starting an SGLT2 inhibitor could reduce the risk of DKA and make the drug safer for the person with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe committee were aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese",

It is important to tell people about these risks and to advise them to discuss any planned change to a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet with their healthcare professional first.\n\n# Why GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment\n\nThe committee did not recommend a GLP-1 mimetic as first-line treatment for the following reasons:\n\n- GLP-1 mimetics were not cost effective as a class at this (or any) stage of treatment for people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with established cardiovascular disease.\n- Although the ICERs for injectable semaglutide for the various modelled scenarios and stages of treatment fell within a similar range to the ICERs for the individual SGLT2 inhibitors, there was more certainty that the SGLT2s were cost effective as a class. In contrast, the ICERs for injectable semaglutide increased significantly in a sensitivity analysis, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the results.\n- There were differences in clinical effectiveness between the injectable and oral forms of semaglutide compared with placebo for some outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, based on the evidence from the trials. However, the committee agreed it was uncertain whether the observed differences in effect were real or might be related to the relatively small size and low event rates in these trials compared with other trials included in the review, which resulted in wide 95% confidence intervals around the effect estimates for some outcomes.\n- The committee concluded that the factors above combined to give such a high level of uncertainty around the clinical and cost effectiveness of injectable semaglutide that they could not make a positive recommendation for its use.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice",

This is also expected to be the case for people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as this category is expected to cover a large proportion of adults with type 2 diabetes. In current practice, these people would not be offered combination therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor until additional treatment is needed to control their HbA1c to below their individually agreed threshold for intervention, and then only if they met the criteria in the relevant NICE technology appraisals for being prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor.

In particular, there might be reasons, such as problems with adherence or adverse effects, that might make existing treatments less effective or ineffective. Addressing these might mean that adding a new drug is unnecessary.\n\nThe list of factors to think about as part of optimisation is not exhaustive but includes those that the committee thought were particularly important. The committee agreed that it is important to revisit advice about diet and lifestyle because part of this discussion is to ensure the person is supported with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to improve their current health and prognosis.\n\nReviews should also take into account a person's current clinical circumstances (as detailed in recommendation 1.7.1 on choosing drug treatments). This will help ensure that appropriate treatment options are considered if the person's clinical situation has changed: for example, if it has improved because of weight loss or if they have developed chronic heart failure or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhen people with an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease turn 40, their cardiovascular risk may appear to drop when it is assessed using QRISK3. However, this is due to switching from assessing lifetime risk to a 10-year risk calculation rather than an actual decrease in cardiovascular risk.

However, in the committee's experience, people with diabetes are often unaware of this and may not be having regular oral health reviews. To address this, the committee recommended routinely discussing the risk of periodontitis at annual reviews, alongside eye disease and foot problems.\n\nThe evidence also showed that periodontal treatment is cost effective for people with type 2 diabetes, assuming improvements in HbA1c are maintained. This was tested with health economic modelling in a range of different scenarios. There were some scenarios where periodontal treatment was not cost effective, but the committee did not think these scenarios reflected real-world practice.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nFor oral healthcare professionals, the long-term impact of the recommendations is uncertain. The recommendations specify that people should follow existing NICE.\n\n© NICE 2025. All rights reserved.

However, the recommendations may also increase awareness of periodontitis, leading to a possible short-term increase in the number of oral health reviews. Any increase in the number of oral health reviews will potentially impact on services, as NHS dental services already have capacity issues.\n\nA short-term increase in the number of oral health reviews will also lead to a short-term increase in costs. However, there is likely to be a larger long-term reduction in costs from the improvement to oral health and diabetes control.\n\nOral healthcare and dental teams will need clear advice on what they need to do for people with diabetes. They will need clear care pathways to improve quality of care and service delivery, in line with the NHS England commissioning standard on dental care for people with diabetes.\n\nMany people do not have regular oral health reviews, even if they are eligible for free NHS dental care.

Type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with obesity, physical inactivity, raised blood pressure, periodontitis, disturbed blood lipid levels and a tendency to develop thrombosis, and is therefore recognised to have an increased cardiovascular risk. It is associated with long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications, together with reduced quality of life and life expectancy.\n\nIn 2019, approximately 3.2 million adults in the UK had diagnosed diabetes. About 90% of these people had type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people of African, African-Caribbean and South Asian family background. It can occur in all age groups and is increasingly being diagnosed in adolescents and young adults.\n\nMultiple vascular risk factors and wide-ranging complications make diabetes care complex and time-consuming, and many areas of healthcare services must be involved for optimal management. Necessary lifestyle changes, and the complexities and possible side effects of therapy, make structured education and self-management important aspects of diabetes care. Diabetes care is estimated to account for at least 5% of UK healthcare expenditure, and up to 10% of NHS expenditure.",

The current practice of 'stopping rules' is typically motivated by either inadequate blood glucose control (rising HbA1c levels) or intolerable side effects. There is limited understanding of the short- and long-term effects of stopping a therapy and switching to another in terms of diabetes control (HbA1c levels), hypoglycaemic risk, weight gain, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, there is limited understanding of how quickly consideration should be given to stopping and switching to another drug treatment and, if stopping and switching may be needed, what the optimal sequencing is of drug treatments.

To date, research evidence has largely focused on metformin-based treatment combinations. Given the progressive nature of the condition, in which intensification of blood glucose lowering drug therapies are indicated over time, there is little evidence, for some adults, to guide management strategies on treatment combinations that do not include metformin. Randomised controlled trials are therefore needed to better understand the treatment choices that are available which improve blood glucose control and long-term risks of complications associated with diabetes.\n\n# 3 Drug treatment for when blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin combinations\n\nWhen blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled by 3 oral antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin combinations, which blood glucose lowering therapies should be used to control blood glucose levels? [2015, amended 2021]\n\nWhy this is important\n\nAs the incidence of type 2 diabetes increases in the younger population and as blood glucose control declines naturally over time, it is likely that further intensification of therapies would be needed. Currently, there is evidence up to second intensification of drug therapies, that is, when 2 or more non-insulin-based treatment combinations fail to adequately control blood glucose levels. Randomised controlled trials are needed to improve understanding of alternative treatment options for adults at second intensification whose blood glucose is inadequately controlled with insulin and/or triple non-insulin-based drug therapies.\n\n# 4 Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels\n\nWhat is the optimal frequency for self-monitoring of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes?

They were aware of examples from current practice in which adults who have insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and use intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) have had good outcomes. Because of the additional cost associated with CGM and the large number of adults with type 2 diabetes, the committee used both the evidence and their clinical experience to decide who would gain the most benefit from using CGM.\n\nThere was evidence that intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) was cost effective for adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin, but no evidence for populations not using insulin, so the committee agreed to restrict their recommendations to that subpopulation.\n\nPeople who have recurrent or severe hypoglycaemic events were identified as one of the groups likely to benefit most from isCGM, because hypoglycaemic events were considered to be one of the most important and concerning outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes who are using insulin. The committee decided that the number of hypoglycaemic events was a more effective indicator of someone who would benefit from isCGM than specific HbA1c target values, because target values can vary between people. The evidence also indicated minimal effects of isCGM on HbA1c values.",

All rights reserved. Subject to Notice of rights (https://www.nice.org.uk/terms-and-conditions#notice-of-rights).\n\n\n\nType 2 diabetes in adults: management (NG28)\n\nPeople who use insulin and have a condition or disability that restricts their ability to self-monitor blood glucose levels should also be offered isCGM. This is because having access to isGCM means they will no longer have to rely on others to monitor their diabetes, potentially increasing their independence. For people with learning disabilities, this recommendation is in line with similar guidance for type 1 diabetes set out in the NHS RightCare Pathway, which specifies reasonable adjustments for people with a learning disability who have diabetes.\n\nPeople who are advised to self-measure using capillary blood glucose monitoring more than 8 times a day should also be offered isCGM. This is in line with the funding requirements for NHS England's flash glucose monitoring: national arrangements for funding of relevant diabetes patients. Although the funding requirements are specifically for people with type 1 diabetes, the committee thought that this criterion was also important for people with type 2 diabetes who have to monitor their blood glucose levels multiple times a day.\n\nPeople who need help from a care worker or other healthcare professional to administer their insulin injections should also be offered isCGM, even if they only use once-daily insulin injections. isCGM will help care workers to record a person's blood glucose levels quickly. And for people who have multiple home care visits per day, blood glucose levels can be recorded at each visit. This will help them to adjust their insulin levels to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemic events between home visits. It may also reduce the number of hospital admissions for this group.\n\nThe committee discussed how short-term use of isCGM may still be useful for some people. It may help people to understand when they have hypoglycaemic episodes, which would help them to develop a more effective treatment plan.",

They noted, however, that prices of rtCGM have reduced over the past few years, and if this continues to happen there may come a time when it is no more expensive than isCGM.

The ability to self-monitor blood glucose levels allows people to ensure the accuracy of the CGM device. The committee also recommended keeping capillary blood glucose monitoring as a back-up for situations such as when the technology fails.\n\nThe committee decided to highlight that CGM should be provided by a team who have expertise in its use. To ensure that CGM is effective, healthcare professionals need to have the skills to interpret and communicate the data effectively. As well as healthcare professionals having a clear understanding of CGM, it is also crucial that people with type 2 diabetes who are using CGM have education about the technology. This will increase the likelihood that people will scan and report the results frequently, allowing people to understand and manage their diabetes effectively.\n\nAlthough many people will choose CGM if offered, there are some people who either cannot be offered it or do not want to use it. Because it is still important for these people to monitor their blood glucose levels, the committee made a recommendation to reinforce the importance of offering capillary blood glucose monitoring instead.",

To address this, the committee made a recommendation outlining actions for commissioners, providers and healthcare professionals.\n\nThe committee highlighted the importance of routinely reviewing a person's use of CGM.

Therefore, they retained the 2015 recommendations outlining the drug treatment options for people in the lower risk group.\n\n# Assessing cardiovascular status\n\nThe committee agreed it was important to assess people's cardiovascular status and risk to help determine which treatments are suitable for them. They used a definition for the established cardiovascular disease group (adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) that reflected the people included in all the clinical trials and modelled as a subgroup in the economic model.\n\nTo assess whether people are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the committee recommended using the QRISK3 tool because this is recommended in NICE's guideline on cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification for adults with type 2 diabetes, and the factors covered by this tool were similar to those used in the trials and economic model to define this population. In addition, this tool is widely used in current practice in the NHS.\n\nLifetime cardiovascular risk may be underestimated in people aged under 40 using this tool, so the committee also included risk factors to consider for this age group. This definition was broadly aligned to the subgroup of people with high cardiovascular risk without established cardiovascular disease who were included in the model.\n\n# Choosing an SGLT2 inhibitor with cardiovascular benefit",

For people without a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease who do not have chronic heart failure or established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, metformin monotherapy remains the recommended first-line treatment option, based on the 2015 recommendation.\n\nWhen starting first-line dual therapy, the committee noted the importance of introducing the drugs sequentially. This enables any side effects and intolerances from the first drug to be identified before the second drug is introduced. In line with current practice, the committee recommended starting with metformin and then adding the SGLT2 inhibitor without delay once metformin tolerability is established, to avoid people remaining on metformin alone for prolonged periods.\n\nSome people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor.

    "text": "agreed with the assumption that people who cannot tolerate metformin or for whom it is contraindicated would be offered the next most effective and cost-effective treatment options after metformin.\n\nIn the economic model scenario, when another drug was used in place of metformin for people with established cardiovascular disease or at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, SGLT2 inhibitors were the class of drugs that were most likely to be cost effective. The committee therefore prioritised this class of drugs for these people. As before, there was greater certainty in the results for people with established cardiovascular disease compared with those at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and the rationale for referring to SGLT2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit also applies here.\n\nSome people will have established cardiovascular disease or a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, but not be able to take an SGLT2 inhibitor or metformin. There was no evidence specifically for this group so the committee made the same assumption as above (that these people would take the next most effective and cost-effective treatment). The committee did not recommend a specific drug for these people because GLP-1 mimetics were not cost-effective options in this situation (see the rationale and impact section on why GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment). They agreed that in practice prescribers would use their clinical judgement to choose an appropriate treatment from the remaining options, based on the individual clinical circumstances and needs of the person with type 2 diabetes (see recommendation 1.7.1).\n\n# Safety considerations for SGLT2 inhibitors\n\nThe committee noted some particularly important safety considerations to take into account before an adult with type 2 diabetes starts on an SGLT2 inhibitor. The committee highlighted these because the SGLT2 inhibitors are comparatively new drugs and clinical experience with them is low in primary care, but the new recommendations are expected to greatly increase their use in this setting. In the committee's experience there have been multiple instances of avoidable diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resulting in hospital admission. The committee highlighted some factors that might put someone at higher risk of DKA, but the list is not intended to be exhaustive. Addressing modifiable risk factors before starting an SGLT2 inhibitor could reduce the risk of DKA and make the drug safer for the person with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe committee were aware that adults with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese",

It is important to tell people about these risks and to advise them to discuss any planned change to a very low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet with their healthcare professional first.\n\n# Why GLP-1 mimetics were not recommended as first-line treatment\n\nThe committee did not recommend a GLP-1 mimetic as first-line treatment for the following reasons:\n\n- GLP-1 mimetics were not cost effective as a class at this (or any) stage of treatment for people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease or with established cardiovascular disease.\n- Although the ICERs for injectable semaglutide for the various modelled scenarios and stages of treatment fell within a similar range to the ICERs for the individual SGLT2 inhibitors, there was more certainty that the SGLT2s were cost effective as a class. In contrast, the ICERs for injectable semaglutide increased significantly in a sensitivity analysis, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the results.\n- There were differences in clinical effectiveness between the injectable and oral forms of semaglutide compared with placebo for some outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, based on the evidence from the trials. However, the committee agreed it was uncertain whether the observed differences in effect were real or might be related to the relatively small size and low event rates in these trials compared with other trials included in the review, which resulted in wide 95% confidence intervals around the effect estimates for some outcomes.\n- The committee concluded that the factors above combined to give such a high level of uncertainty around the clinical and cost effectiveness of injectable semaglutide that they could not make a positive recommendation for its use.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice",

This is also expected to be the case for people with a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease, as this category is expected to cover a large proportion of adults with type 2 diabetes. In current practice, these people would not be offered combination therapy with an SGLT2 inhibitor until additional treatment is needed to control their HbA1c to below their individually agreed threshold for intervention, and then only if they met the criteria in the relevant NICE technology appraisals for being prescribed an SGLT2 inhibitor.

In particular, there might be reasons, such as problems with adherence or adverse effects, that might make existing treatments less effective or ineffective. Addressing these might mean that adding a new drug is unnecessary.\n\nThe list of factors to think about as part of optimisation is not exhaustive but includes those that the committee thought were particularly important. The committee agreed that it is important to revisit advice about diet and lifestyle because part of this discussion is to ensure the person is supported with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to improve their current health and prognosis.\n\nReviews should also take into account a person's current clinical circumstances (as detailed in recommendation 1.7.1 on choosing drug treatments). This will help ensure that appropriate treatment options are considered if the person's clinical situation has changed: for example, if it has improved because of weight loss or if they have developed chronic heart failure or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhen people with an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease turn 40, their cardiovascular risk may appear to drop when it is assessed using QRISK3.

Type 2 diabetes is commonly associated with obesity, physical inactivity, raised blood pressure, periodontitis, disturbed blood lipid levels and a tendency to develop thrombosis, and is therefore recognised to have an increased cardiovascular risk. It is associated with long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications, together with reduced quality of life and life expectancy.\n\nIn 2019, approximately 3.2 million adults in the UK had diagnosed diabetes. About 90% of these people had type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people of African, African-Caribbean and South Asian family background. It can occur in all age groups and is increasingly being diagnosed in adolescents and young adults.\n\nMultiple vascular risk factors and wide-ranging complications make diabetes care complex and time-consuming, and many areas of healthcare services must be involved for optimal management. Necessary lifestyle changes, and the complexities and possible side effects of therapy, make structured education and self-management important aspects of diabetes care. Diabetes care is estimated to account for at least 5% of UK healthcare expenditure, and up to 10% of NHS expenditure.",

When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.\n\nAll problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.\n\nLocal commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.\n\nCommissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.\n\n© NICE 2025.

    "text": "The committee noted the importance of information that offers hope for the future and supports self-management strategies (for example, information that emphasises symptom-reducing behaviours, like therapeutic exercise). They agreed that explaining the core treatments for osteoarthritis would help people understand that pharmacological treatments are not a long-term solution. They also agreed that information about recognising flares and how to manage changes in pain would help the person better understand how their condition may vary over time and what they can do about it. The committee noted more evidence was needed on information about managing flares and information for different populations of people with osteoarthritis, and so made recommendations for research on what information people with osteoarthritis need.\n\nThe committee agreed that each person's experience of osteoarthritis differs and therefore tailoring the information to their needs, as described in NICE's guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services, is important. They also agreed that osteoarthritis is more common in older people who are likely to have other conditions. Therefore, the recommendations on delivering an approach to care that takes account of multimorbidity in NICE's guideline on multimorbidity are particularly relevant to people with osteoarthritis.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nThe recommendations generally reflect current practice because information is likely to be already provided, but they advise on areas in which practice can be improved.\n\n# Return to recommendations\n\n# Therapeutic exercise\n\n# Recommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.4\n\n© NICE 2025.

In particular, the committee highlighted the importance of therapeutic exercise to help manage and reduce symptoms and improve or maintain physical functioning over the long term.

    "text": "Limited evidence showed that supervised exercise had some benefits compared with unsupervised exercise. The committee's expert consensus was that supervised exercise is likely to be of greater benefit than unsupervised exercise for people with osteoarthritis. This is because supervised exercise may enable tailored exercise and social support, which may increase adherence and lead to people with osteoarthritis forming a regular exercise habit.\n\nThe committee also agreed that shared decision making is important when deciding the form of exercise delivery and type of exercise, as well as considering personal preference and service availability. The committee, acknowledging the importance of exercise, made further recommendations to support people to continue therapeutic exercise by emphasising its benefits while acknowledging that exercise may initially be difficult. They wanted to reassure people with osteoarthritis and healthcare professionals that exercise is not harmful to osteoarthritic joints, and that doing regular and consistent exercise over a long period of time can reduce pain and increase functioning and quality of life.\n\nThe committee noted that further evidence may be needed and made a recommendation for research to compare the clinical and cost effectiveness of supervised group and individual exercise with unsupervised exercise.\n\nEvidence showed that treatment packages had a clinically important benefit on physical function compared with education or behaviour change interventions alone. They also had consistent beneficial changes in quality of life, pain and physical function compared with standard care. However, they showed no superiority to individual therapies (such as exercise, manual therapy and electrotherapy). The committee agreed that a person-centred approach is important. Additional education or behavioural change approaches may help some people achieve their goals, but others may not need this. Therefore, the committee recommended combining therapeutic exercise as part of a structured treatment package because this may be more suitable for some people and motivate them.\n\n© NICE 2025.

However, for people with knee osteoarthritis, the evidence generally showed that as more weight was lost, the benefits for quality of life, pain and physical function increased. The committee acknowledged the challenges people can have with losing weight and maintaining this weight loss, and recommended that they are supported.\n\nThe committee acknowledged that, for people who are overweight, losing more than 10% of their body weight may be the most beneficial, but this may not be achievable for all. They wanted to emphasise that losing any amount of weight would be beneficial, but that losing more would have more benefits. They agreed that also explaining that losing 10% of their body weight is likely to be better than 5% might help provide an incentive and encourage weight loss. They also agreed that advising on the amount of weight to lose can help people with osteoarthritis by providing a target for them to work towards.\n\nThe committee determined that, although evidence was from people with knee osteoarthritis, this could be applied to people with other osteoarthritis-affected joints. This is because of the potential additional benefits of weight loss seen in other populations, such as reducing inflammatory factors, that may be beneficial for all joint sites and general wellbeing. The committee also agreed that osteoarthritis is a multi-joint disease and people presenting with the condition in 1 joint may end up getting it in another. Weight loss\n\n© NICE 2025.

However, the benefits were stronger if manual therapy was combined with exercise. Clinical and economic evidence showed that exercise alone was more effective than both manual therapy alone and the combination of manual therapy and exercise. So, the committee concluded that manual therapy should only be considered alongside therapeutic exercise. Most studies provided therapy for less than 3 months and on average for 7 weeks. The committee agreed that the duration of manual therapy would be similar, but would vary according to the person's needs. They agreed that further research was needed, in particular evidence from well-powered, high-quality studies with adequate blinding and on other osteoarthritis-affected joints. They made a recommendation for research on manual therapy for people with osteoarthritis used alone and in combination with therapeutic exercise.\n\n# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\nCurrent practice around manual therapy varies.

Economic evidence also showed that using acupuncture for osteoarthritis is not cost effective, so the committee did not recommend using acupuncture or dry needling. There was some evidence of clinical benefit and cost effectiveness for electroacupuncture but this was of very low quality because of small study sizes and inconsistency between studies. The evidence for electroacupuncture suggested it showed a benefit compared with sham acupuncture but not compared with acupuncture or no treatment. The committee considered that the inconsistent evidence could be the result of some people responding more to electroacupuncture than others. Because there is uncertainty about who might benefit from electroacupuncture, the committee made a recommendation for research on electroacupuncture for osteoarthritis.",

However, capsaicin is more expensive and topical NSAIDs were considered a better option. The committee made a recommendation for research on topical medicines for osteoarthritis-affected joints other than the knee.\n\nOral NSAIDs were found to be cost effective and evidence showed they slightly reduced pain and increased physical function. The committee acknowledged the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) safety warnings on NSAIDs for cardiovascular safety, renal safety and gastrointestinal risk. They agreed that NSAIDs, as well as other pharmacological treatments for osteoarthritis, should be used for as short a time as possible and that the potential harms for gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, liver and kidney adverse events should be carefully considered when prescribing.\n\nEvidence showed that adding gastroprotection can reduce gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation. However, this was associated with an increase in cardiovascular adverse events compared with oral NSAIDs alone. The committee agreed that this may be unrelated to the addition of gastroprotection and that randomised controlled trial evidence alone may not be the best source for safety evidence, because the population size and length of follow-up are usually limited. Therefore, they also used their clinical experience and guidance from other organisations, including the MHRA.

But it was unclear who should do this imaging because some surgeons may only accept a referral for surgery if they are provided with imaging results, whereas others may prefer to do their own imaging after referral.

The committee agreed that the decision to refer someone for joint replacement should be based on clinical assessment after trying all appropriate treatments for that person. These should have been tried for a sufficient length of time to ensure they are not effective at reducing symptoms before referral happens. Given the absence of evidence, the committee made a recommendation for research on indicators for joint replacement in people with osteoarthritis.\n\nEvidence on weight loss before surgery showed that, after hip or knee replacement, there was no difference in outcomes for people in different body mass index (BMI) categories. People who were overweight or obese based on BMI did not have an increased mortality rate after surgery and had improved health-related quality of life and patient-reported outcome measures. For people who were underweight based on BMI, evidence showed an increased mortality rate. However, the committee considered that this may be due to comorbidities and that the effect may be exaggerated by the smaller number of underweight participants in studies. Some studies combined the healthy weight group with the underweight group, which made interpreting the evidence more difficult. The committee acknowledged that BMI can give a false impression of the risks and that other factors need to be considered, such as comorbidities. The committee concluded that BMI, and other measurements of whether someone is overweight or obese, should not be a barrier to joint replacement.\n\nSimilarly, the committee agreed that everyone should be treated equally, and people should not be excluded from referral for joint replacement based on their age, sex or gender, if they smoke or any comorbidities.

    "text": "Osteoarthritis in over 16s: diagnosis and management (NG226)\n\n# Arthroscopic procedures\n\n# Recommendation 1.7.1\n\n# Why the committee made the recommendation\n\nThere was no evidence showing that arthroscopic procedures reduce pain and improve physical function. Evidence also showed possible harms with arthroscopic procedures compared with sham procedures. Cost-effectiveness evidence showed that arthroscopic procedures were more costly than standard care.\n\n# The committee agreed that arthroscopic procedures were not commonly used in clinical practice for osteoarthritis.\n\n# How the recommendation might affect practice\n\nThe recommendation reflects current practice, so there should be no change in practice or resource impact.\n\nReturn to recommendation\n\n© NICE 2025.

Page 39 of 42\n\n\n\n\n\n# Osteoarthritis in over 16s: diagnosis and management (NG226)\n\nContext\n\nOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It typically presents with joint symptoms such as pain and stiffness, mostly affecting the knee, hip, hand and foot joints. Symptoms vary from mild and intermittent, to more persistent or severe. The condition does not inevitably get worse, but symptoms fluctuate and flares are common. Osteoarthritis has a negative impact on daily activities, quality of life and health outcomes. It can affect people's physical, social and emotional life; more than half of people with osteoarthritis report that it seriously affects their family and working life.\n\nOsteoarthritis is more common in women, people living in deprived areas, people aged 45 and over and people living with obesity. The prevalence of osteoarthritis is increasing. Many people with osteoarthritis have multiple long-term conditions, making their care more complex.\n\nNICE produced a guideline on the care and management of osteoarthritis in 2014. This updated guideline makes recommendations on diagnosing and managing osteoarthritis, based on new evidence. This includes information and support, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments, follow-up, and referral for joint replacement. The aim of this guideline is to improve management of osteoarthritis and the quality of life for people with the condition.",

When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.\n\nAll problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.\n\nLocal commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.\n\nCommissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.\n\n© NICE 2025.

The most common causes are peptic ulcer and oesophago-gastric varices.\n\nEndoscopy is the primary diagnostic investigation in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding but it has not always been clear whether urgent endoscopy is cost effective as well as clinically valuable. Endoscopy aids diagnosis, yields information that helps predict outcome and most importantly allows treatments to be delivered that can stop bleeding and reduce the risk of re-bleeding.\n\nDrugs may have a complementary role in reducing gastric acid secretion and portal vein pressure.
