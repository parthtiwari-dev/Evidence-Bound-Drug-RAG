NICE Use FeverPAIN or Centor to assess symptoms:

- FeverPAIN 0-1 or Centor 0-2: no antibiotic;
- FeverPAIN 2-3: no or back-up antibiotic;
- FeverPAIN 4-5 or Centor 3-4: immediate or back-up antibiotic.

Systemically very unwell or high risk of complications: immediate antibiotic.

*5 days of phenoxymethylpenicillin may be enough for symptomatic cure; but a 10-day course may increase the chance of microbiological cure. For detailed information click the visual summary icon.

# Influenza

Annual vaccination is essential for all those ‘at risk’ of influenza.¹ᴰ Antivirals are not recommended for healthy adults.1D,2A+

Treat ‘at risk’ patients with 5 days oseltamivir 75mg BD,¹ᴰ when influenza is circulating in the community, and ideally within 48 hours of onset (36 hours for zanamivir treatment in children),1D,3D or in a care home where influenza is likely.1D,2A+

At risk: pregnant (and up to 2 weeks post-partum); children under 6 months; adults 65 years or older; chronic respiratory disease (including COPD and asthma); significant cardiovascular disease (not hypertension); severe immunosuppression; chronic neurological, renal or liver disease; diabetes mellitus; morbid obesity (BMI>40).⁴ᴰ See the PHE Influenza guidance for the treatment of patients under 13 years.⁴ᴰ In severe immunosuppression, or oseltamivir resistance, use zanamivir 10mg BD5A+,6A+ (2 inhalations twice daily by diskhaler for up to 10 days) and seek advice.⁴ᴰ

# Lower respiratory tract infections

COVID-19 Antibiotics should not be used for preventing or treating COVID-19 unless there is clinical suspicion of additional bacterial co-infection. Do not use azithromycin to treat COVID-19. Do not use doxycycline to treat COVID-19 in the community. Do not offer an antibiotic for preventing secondary bacterial pneumonia in people with COVID-19.

Last updated: December 2021 If a person in the community has suspected or confirmed secondary bacterial pneumonia, start antibiotic treatment as soon as possible, see community-acquired pneumonia for choices. In hospital, start empirical antibiotics if there is clinical suspicion of a secondary bacterial infection in people with COVID-19, see hospital-acquired pneumonia for choices. Start antibiotics as soon as possible after establishing a diagnosis of secondary bacterial pneumonia, and certainly within 4 hours. Start treatment within 1 hour if the person has suspected sepsis and meets any of the high-risk criteria for this outlined in the NICE guideline on sepsis.

For detailed information, see the NICE guideline on managing COVID-19.

Many exacerbations are not caused by bacterial infections so will not respond to antibiotics. Consider an antibiotic, but only after taking into account severity of symptoms (particularly sputum colour changes and increases in volume or thickness), need for hospitalisation, previous exacerbations, hospitalisations and risk of complications, previous sputum culture and susceptibility results, and risk of resistance with repeated courses.

Some people at risk of exacerbations may have antibiotics to keep at home as part of their exacerbation action plan. For detailed information click on the visual summary. See also the NICE guideline on COPD in over 16s.

# Key points

# Acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis (non-cystic fibrosis)

Send a sputum sample for culture and susceptibility testing.

Offer an antibiotic.

When choosing an antibiotic, take account of severity of symptoms and risk of treatment failure. People who may be at higher risk of treatment failure include people who’ve had repeated courses of antibiotics, a previous sputum culture with resistant or atypical bacteria, or a higher risk of developing complications.

# Public Health England

Course length is based on severity of bronchiectasis, exacerbation history, severity of exacerbation symptoms, previous culture and susceptibility results, and response to treatment.

Do not routinely offer antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent exacerbations.

Seek specialist advice for preventing exacerbations in people with repeated acute exacerbations. This may include a trial of antibiotic prophylaxis after a discussion of the possible benefits and harms, and the need for regular review.

For first choice IV antibiotics (severe or higher risk of resistance) and antibiotics to be added if suspected or confirmed MRSA infection see visual summary.

Last updated: Sept 2019

No validated severity assessment tools are available. Assess severity of symptoms or signs based on clinical judgement.

Higher risk of resistance includes relevant comorbidity (such as severe lung disease or immunosuppression), recent use of broad spectrum antibiotics, colonisation with multi-drug resistant bacteria, and recent contact with health and social care settings before current admission.

If symptoms or signs of pneumonia start within days 3 to 5 of hospital admission in people not at higher risk of resistance, consider following community acquired pneumonia for choice of antibiotic.

Summary of antimicrobial prescribing guidance – managing common infections (March 2022)

# Infection

# Key points

# Community-acquired pneumonia

Assess severity in adults based on clinical judgement and guided by a mortality risk score (CRB65 or CURB65) when these scores can be calculated:

- low severity – CRB65 0 or CURB65 0 or 1
- moderate severity – CRB65 1 or 2 or CURB65 2
- high severity – CRB65 3 or 4 or CURB65 3 to 5.

1 point for each parameter: confusion, (urea >7 mmol/l), respiratory rate ≥30/min, low systolic (&#x3C;90 mm Hg) or diastolic (≤60 mm Hg) blood pressure, age ≥65.

# NICE

Assess severity in children based on clinical judgement. Offer an antibiotic. Start treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis, within 4 hours (within 1 hour if sepsis suspected and person meets any high risk criteria – see the NICE guideline on sepsis).

When choosing an antibiotic, take account of severity, risk of complications, local antimicrobial resistance and surveillance data, recent antibiotic use and microbiological results.

* Stop antibiotics after 5 days unless microbiological results suggest a longer course is needed or the person is not clinically stable.

# Key points

# Acute pyelonephritis (upper urinary tract)

Advise paracetamol (+/- low-dose weak opioid) for pain for people over 12.

Offer an antibiotic. When prescribing antibiotics, take account of severity of symptoms, risk of complications, previous urine culture and susceptibility results, previous antibiotic use which may have led to resistant bacteria and local antimicrobial resistance data.

Avoid antibiotics that don’t achieve adequate levels in renal tissue, such as nitrofurantoin. For detailed information click on the visual summary.

Summary of antimicrobial prescribing guidance – managing common infections (March 2022)






# Infection

# Key points

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection

Antibiotic treatment is not routinely needed for asymptomatic bacteriuria in people with a urinary catheter.

Consider removing or, if not possible, changing the catheter if it has been in place for more than 7 days. But do not delay antibiotic treatment.

Last updated: Jul 2021

Do not offer antimotility medicines such as loperamide. Offer an oral antibiotic to treat suspected or confirmed C. difficile infection. For adults, consider seeking prompt specialist advice from a microbiologist or infectious diseases specialist before starting treatment. For children and young people, treatment should be started by, or after advice from, a microbiologist, paediatric infectious diseases specialist or paediatric gastroenterologist. If antibiotics have been started for suspected C. difficile infection, and subsequent stool sample tests do not confirm infection, consider stopping these antibiotics.

As single dose azithromycin has led to increased resistance in GU infections, doxycycline should be used first line for chlamydia and urethritis.⁴ᴬ⁺

Last updated: July 2019

Advise patient with chlamydia to abstain from sexual intercourse until doxycycline is completed or for 7 days after treatment with azithromycin (14 days after azithromycin started and until symptoms resolved if urethritis).3A+,4A+

If chlamydia, test for reinfection at 3 to 6 months following treatment if under 25 years; or consider if over 25 years and high risk of re-infection.¹ᴮ⁻,3B+, ⁵ᴮ⁻

Second line, pregnant, breastfeeding, allergy, or intolerance: azithromycin is most effective.6A+,7D,8A+,9A+,10D As lower cure rate in pregnancy, test for cure at least 3 weeks after end of treatment.³ᴬ⁺

Consider referring all patients with symptomatic urethritis to GUM as testing should include Mycoplasma genitalium and Gonorrhoea.¹¹ᴬ⁻

If M.genitalium is proven, use doxycycline followed by azithromycin using the same dosing regimen and advise to avoid sex for 14 days after start of treatment and until symptoms have resolved.¹¹ᴬ⁻,12A+

When treating with malathion: also treat face and scalp.12

Home/sexual contacts: treat within 24 hours.1

# Insect bites and stings

Most insect bites or stings will not need antibiotics.

Do not offer an antibiotic if there are no symptoms or signs of infection.

If there are symptoms or signs of infection, see cellulitis and erysipelas.

Last updated: Sep 2020

# Leg ulcer infection

Manage any underlying conditions to promote ulcer healing.

Only offer an antibiotic when there are symptoms or signs of infection (such as redness or swelling spreading beyond the ulcer, localised warmth, increased pain or fever). Few leg ulcers are clinically infected but most are colonised by bacteria.

First-choice: flucloxacillin 500mg to 1g QDS - 7 days

Penicillin allergy or if flucloxacillin unsuitable: doxycycline OR 200mg on day 1, then 100mg OD (can be increased to 200mg daily) - 7 days

clarithromycin OR erythromycin (if macrolide needed in pregnancy; consider benefit/harm) 500mg QDS

Second choice: co-amoxiclav OR 500/125mg TDS - 7 days

co-trimoxazole (in penicillin allergy) 960mg BD

Completing the course is important because positive effects can take 6 to 8 weeks. Consider topical benzoyl peroxide monotherapy as an alternative if first-line treatment options are contraindicated, or to avoid topical retinoids or an antibiotic (topical or oral). | Do not use: monotherapy with a topical antibiotic, monotherapy with an oral antibiotic, or a combination of a topical antibiotic and an oral antibiotic. Review first-line treatment at 12 weeks. Only continue a topical or oral antibiotic for more than 6 months in exceptional circumstances. Review at 3 monthly intervals, and stop the antibiotic as soon as possible. For detailed information see the NICE guideline on acne vulgaris. | Last updated: Jun 2021 |                |

# Dermatophyte infection: skin

Most cases: use terbinafine as fungicidal, treatment time shorter and more effective than with fungistatic imidazoles or undecenoates. If candida possible, use imidazole. If intractable, or scalp: send skin scrapings, and if infection confirmed: use oral terbinafine or itraconazole. Scalp: oral therapy, and discuss with specialist.

# Last updated:

Feb 2019

# Dermatophyte infection: nail

Take nail clippings; start therapy only if infection is confirmed. Oral terbinafine is more effective than oral azole. Liver reactions 0.1 to 1% with oral antifungals. If candida or non-dermatophyte infection is confirmed, use oral itraconazole. Topical nail lacquer is not as effective. To prevent recurrence: apply weekly 1% topical antifungal cream to entire toe area. Children: seek specialist advice.

# Suspected dental infections in primary care (outside dental settings)

Derived from the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme (SDCEP) 2013 Guidelines. This guidance is not designed to be a definitive guide to oral conditions, as GPs should not be involved in dental treatment. Patients presenting to non-dental primary care services with dental problems should be directed to their regular dentist, or if this is not possible, to the NHS 111 service (in England), who will be able to provided details of how to access emergency dental care.

Note: Antibiotics do not cure toothache.¹ᴰ First-line treatment is with paracetamol¹ᴰ and/or ibuprofen;¹ᴰ codeine is not effective for toothache.¹ᴰ

# Mucosal ulceration and inflammation (simple gingivitis)

Temporary pain and swelling relief can be attained with saline mouthwash (½ tsp salt in warm water)¹ᴰ. Use antiseptic mouthwash if more severe,¹ᴰ and if pain limits oral hygiene to treat or prevent secondary infection.1D,2A⁻ The primary cause for mucosal ulceration or inflammation (aphthous ulcers;¹ᴰ oral lichen planus;¹ᴰ herpes simplex infection;¹ᴰ oral cancer)¹ᴰ needs to be evaluated and treated.¹ᴰ
